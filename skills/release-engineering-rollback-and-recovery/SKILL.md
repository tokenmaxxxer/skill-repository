# Rollback and recovery

## Trigger

Apply this skill when an incident correlates with a recent release and
a rollback decision is live — whether to roll back, which mechanism to
use for the deployment strategy in play, what to retain at release time
to make rollback possible, and what to confirm before or after a
rollback executes.

## Procedure

1. At release time, retain a detailed change report and the previous
   build's artifact alongside the new one, so a rollback target exists
   before an incident starts (rule 1).
2. When a pre-declared canary/rolling threshold is crossed, roll back
   automatically rather than page a human to decide (rule 2); for
   blue-green, switch back to the still-running previous environment
   immediately rather than attempt a fix-forward patch (rule 3).
3. When root cause is unclear but a recent release correlates with
   onset, roll back first and investigate after (rule 4).
4. At release time, design any accompanying migration as
   rollback-compatible (additive-first, backward-compatible reads),
   never discovering at incident time that it has no reverse path (rule
   5).
5. Budget incident-response time for rolling deployment's slower,
   instance-by-instance rollback (rule 6), and prefer flag-flip-off as
   the first rollback action when feature-flag-gated code carries the
   risky change, before falling back to a full rollback (rule 9).
6. After a rollback completes, write a postmortem documenting the
   trigger and whether the threshold fired at the right sensitivity
   (rule 7), and confirm the rollback target's build artifact and
   config bundle are the exact previously-live pairing, not just the
   previous version number (rule 12).
7. Where manual rollback steps recur release after release with no
   growing insight, or engineering time goes disproportionately into
   reactive rollback firefighting past the toil ceiling, automate the
   rollback path (rules 8, 10); prune a rollback runbook's steps for
   scenarios that no longer occur (rule 11).

## Output shape

A rollback decision (execute now / hold) with its mechanism, the
confirmed build/config pairing being rolled back to, and — once
complete — a postmortem covering the trigger and threshold accuracy,
each traceable to the rule above that forced it.

## Rules

1. **When** any release ships, **choose** to retain a detailed change
   report and the previous build's artifact alongside the new one — not
   just the new build — so a rollback target and a diff of "what
   changed" both exist the moment an incident starts.

   artifacts enable targeted fixes/rollbacks) —

2. **When** a canary or rolling deployment's pre-declared error-rate
   threshold is crossed, **choose** automatic rollback over paging a
   human to decide — a pre-declared threshold exists specifically so the
   rollback decision doesn't wait on human judgment under incident
   pressure.

3. **When** a blue-green deployment shows a problem post-switch,
   **choose** to switch traffic back to the still-running previous
   (blue) environment immediately — never attempt a fix-forward patch
   on the new environment first, since the old environment is still
   live and rollback is a single switch.

4. **When** an incident's root cause is unclear but a recent release
   correlates with onset, **choose** to roll back first and investigate
   after — restoring service takes priority over diagnosing root cause
   while the service is degraded.

   recovery path, enabled by retained build artifacts) —
   https://sre.google/sre-book/release-engineering/

5. **When** a rollback itself requires a schema or data migration to
   reverse, **choose** to design the forward migration as
   rollback-compatible (e.g. additive-first, backward-compatible reads)
   at release time — never discover at incident time that the migration
   has no reverse path.

   as the basis for a reliable rollback path) —
   https://sre.google/sre-book/release-engineering/

6. **When** a rolling deployment must be rolled back, **choose** to
   budget incident response time for the slower, instance-by-instance
   reversal that rolling rollback requires, rather than assume rollback
   speed is uniform across deployment strategies.

7. **When** a rollback completes, **choose** to write a postmortem
   documenting what the rollback trigger was and whether the threshold
   fired at the right sensitivity — a rollback with no postmortem loses
   the chance to tune the next release's thresholds.

   back into future release policy) —

8. **When** repeated manual rollback steps recur release after release
   with no growing insight from doing them by hand, **choose** to
   automate the rollback path — a manual, repetitive, automatable step
   that produces no enduring value is toil by definition.

   https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/

9. **When** feature-flag-gated code is the mechanism carrying a risky
   change, **choose** flag-flip-off as the first rollback action (faster
   than a full binary rollback) before falling back to a full release
   rollback if flipping the flag doesn't resolve the incident.

   Development" —

10. **REMOVAL** — **when** engineering time goes disproportionately into
    manual, reactive rollback firefighting (SRE toil budget target:
    engineering work should stay >=50% of time, toil <=50%), **choose**
    to invest in automating the rollback trigger and execution path
    rather than accept the recurring manual cost as a fixed feature of
    releases.

    https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/

11. **REMOVAL** — **when** a rollback runbook has accumulated steps for
    scenarios that no longer occur (e.g. a deprecated deployment target),
    **choose** to prune those steps from the runbook rather than leave
    them for someone to skip manually during an incident — a bloated
    runbook adds cognitive load exactly when speed matters most.

12. **When** a rollback is triggered, **choose** to confirm the rollback
    target build's artifact and config bundle are the exact pairing that
    was previously live (not just "the previous version number") — a
    mismatched config/binary pairing can reintroduce the same incident
    under a different version tag.
