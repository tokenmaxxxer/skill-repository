# finding-record

Belongs to `auditing` (initial recording) and `draft-reported` (dispute
resolution recorded inline, still against the same finding). Produces the
per-requirement finding record inside `review-record.md`, the role's state
file, at the requirement blocks below the header block.

This skill never writes to any file other than `review-record.md`. It does
not fix, patch, or suggest a patch for anything it finds — it reports.

## Trigger

Apply this skill while acting as the review role in the `auditing` or
`draft-reported` state, once a requirement has been checked and its
verdict needs to be written down in `review-record.md` — never to fix or
patch what was found.

## Procedure

1. Record the verdict solo by default; ask the user only when the
   requirement genuinely cannot be checked from what's available, for
   the missing evidence or access (see "What it asks the user for").
2. Choose exactly one of the five verdicts; never merge them into a bare
   pass/fail (see "The verdict set").
3. Fill in the full field list for the requirement block — requirement,
   spec_ref, verdict, evidence, rationale, and spec_vs_built when the
   verdict is Incorrect (see "The artifact and its field list").
4. Refuse to write Present, Surface, Absent, or Incorrect with no
   evidence pointer or no spec_ref (see "Refusal the skill itself
   enforces").
5. In `draft-reported`, record a disputed finding's re-examination
   inline rather than treating the dispute as a request to fix anything
   (see "What it asks the user for").
6. Before writing, run the per-requirement checklist (see
   "Per-requirement checklist").

## Output shape

One `---`-delimited block per requirement inside `review-record.md`,
carrying the full field list and a verdict from the fixed five-value
set, with a write refused when a required evidence pointer or spec_ref
is missing.

## What it asks the user for

Nothing, by default — recording a verdict is the reviewer's own
professional judgment call, made solo, per the interaction research's
finding that severity assignment and "is this a finding at all" both
proceed without asking (`docs/reports/research/2026-07-27-role-interaction/review.md`,
"What proceeds without asking"). The skill asks the user only when it
cannot check a requirement at all from what it has: "the spec requires X
be logged at runtime; I can't observe that from a static diff — can you
point me at a log sample, or should this be `Unverifiable`?" That answer,
or the absence of one, decides the verdict; it does not gate the write.

In `draft-reported`, if the reviewed party disputes a finding, this skill
asks the user to state their side, records it, and re-examines the
evidence — it does not treat the dispute itself as a request to fix
anything.

## The verdict set

Exactly one of, per requirement:

- **`Present`** — implemented as specified.
- **`Surface`** — something exists at the requirement's name or shape, but
  does not actually do what it requires.
- **`Absent`** — nothing addresses the requirement.
- **`Incorrect`** — addressed, but wrong.
- **`Unverifiable`** — the reviewer genuinely cannot check this requirement
  from the evidence and access it has been given; distinct from `Absent`
  (verifiably not there). Added because two independent research passes
  converge on the same gap: Fagan inspection's follow-up phase and AICPA's
  tolerable-deviation framing (practice research), and reviewers'
  repeated, real need to request evidence or access they don't yet have
  before a requirement can be checked at all (interaction research,
  "Moments that call for a human", item 3).

Never merge these into a bare pass/fail.

## The artifact and its field list

Written to `review-record.md`, in this repository's root (path
configurable via `REVIEW_RECORD_NAME`), as one `---`-delimited block per
requirement below the header block. Field list, taken from the practice
research's synthesis of the OWASP finding template, CVSS/bug-bar
precedent, and Fagan inspection's reader-narrates-the-artifact discipline
(`docs/reports/research/2026-07-27-role-practice/review.md`, "What must a
finding record contain to be actionable?"):

1. **`requirement`** — a stable identifier for the specific
   requirement/claim being checked, verbatim from the specification (or a
   stable id if the spec numbers its own requirements).
2. **`spec_ref`** — the exact clause/section/requirement-id in the spec
   being checked against, distinct from the free-text `requirement` field
   above. Where the spec is unnumbered prose, `spec_ref` may be a stable
   locator (heading + paragraph) instead of a formal id, but must not be
   omitted for any verdict other than `Unverifiable` — a traceability
   matrix needs a stable key on both sides (spec side and evidence side),
   and `requirement` alone (free text, potentially paraphrased) does not
   reliably serve as that key across re-review (issue #30 conformance
   methodology proposal, part (b)). EARL counterpart: the marketplace
   `conformance-review` role spec's `test` field (`roles/specs/
   conformance-review.spec.json`, issue-521) — a `ref`-typed pointer to
   the same conformance criterion this field names.
3. **`verdict`** — one of the five values above. EARL counterpart: the
   spec's `result` field — a different 5-value enum
   (`passed|failed|cantTell|inapplicable|untested`) over the same
   cardinality; the value sets do not map 1:1, this is vocabulary
   alignment, not a swap.
4. **`evidence`** — a pointer into the actual diff: file path, line
   number, or hunk. Never a paraphrase of what the diff does — the
   reproduction path itself, mirroring OWASP's mandatory Evidence/PoC
   field and Fagan inspection's rule that the artifact is narrated, not
   summarized from memory. This is what makes the finding actionable: a
   claim of `Incorrect` or `Absent` with no evidence pointer is refused by
   this skill before it is written (see below).
5. **`rationale`** — one line connecting the evidence to the verdict:
   why this evidence supports this verdict, not a restatement of either.
6. **`spec_vs_built`** — required only when `verdict: Incorrect`: what the
   spec required, versus what was actually built. Optional/omitted for
   every other verdict.

The requirement's subject-under-audit (the artifact/commit being checked)
is this skill's EARL counterpart to the spec's `subject` field; the
reviewer's own identity recording a verdict is the counterpart to the
spec's `assertedBy` field — neither has a dedicated field name in this
rulebook's template today, but both are implicit in where the record
lives (`review-record.md`, scoped to one subject) and who writes it.

## EARL alignment (issue-521 spec)

The marketplace `conformance-review` role spec names two rules this
rulebook does not enforce locally, by design (proposal `## Constraints`:
no forked enforcement):

- **`reference_resolution`**: "test must resolve to the actual
  conformance criterion (a spec section, requirement, or lint rule) being
  checked, not a vague description; subject must resolve to a real repo
  path or commit sha." `checked_by`:
  `on-the-record/hooks/role-spec-reference-guard.sh` — owned upstream in
  `tokenmaxxxer/on-the-record`, not vendored here.
- **`recomputation`**: "overall verdict = the worst-case result across
  all cited test entries (failed > cantTell > inapplicable > untested >
  passed), never a standalone summary field asserted independently of the
  cited results (issue-515 invariant 4)." `checked_by`: TBD upstream
  (issue-521 out-of-scope note: per-role recomputation enforcement is a
  follow-up once evidence from real usage shows which roles need it) —
  unenforced anywhere today, including here.

Template at
`review-cycle/skills/finding-record/templates/finding-record-template.md`
is the field skeleton this skill fills in per requirement.

## Refusal the skill itself enforces

This skill refuses to accept a verdict of `Present`, `Surface`, `Absent`,
or `Incorrect` with no `evidence` pointer — mirroring OWASP's mandatory
Evidence/PoC field. `Unverifiable` is the one verdict that may carry an
`evidence` field describing what access/evidence was missing instead of a
diff pointer, since by definition there is no diff evidence to point at.

This skill likewise refuses to accept a verdict of `Present`, `Surface`,
`Absent`, or `Incorrect` with no `spec_ref` — the same traceability
discipline applied to the spec side of the finding rather than the
evidence side. `Unverifiable` is again the one verdict that may omit it,
for the same reason: a requirement that could not be checked at all may
not have had its spec locator pinned down either.

## What this skill never does

- Fix, patch, or propose a patch for anything it records, even if the
  user asks it to while giving an answer — if asked to fix what it found,
  say plainly that this role reports and does not fix, and that the
  finding stands recorded as-is pending the user's own decision on it.
- Merge the five verdicts into pass/fail.
- Write to any file other than `review-record.md`.
- Treat a complete-looking diff as a `Present` verdict without an evidence
  pointer into it.

## Per-requirement checklist

Before writing a verdict for this requirement, confirm:
- [ ] spec_ref names a stable locator (id, or heading+paragraph) — not
      the free-text requirement string itself.
- [ ] evidence is a pointer into the artifact (file:line/hunk) — not a
      paraphrase, not a summary of what the builder said they did.
- [ ] the verdict came from looking at the artifact, not from the
      builder's account of their own intent.
- [ ] if Unverifiable: the reason access was unavailable is named.
- [ ] if closed_checks are cited: code_sha matches this record's own
      code_under_review: (or upstream:), not the working branch HEAD.
