# Authorization / access control

Decision rules for deciding who may act on what, and where that check
runs. Research trail: layer 1 (OWASP Authorization Cheat Sheet) plus
layer 2 (ASVS V4 "Access Control", CWE-862 Missing Authorization,
CWE-863 Incorrect Authorization).

## Rules

1. When no explicit access-control rule matches a request, deny it —
   "the application must always make a decision, whether implicitly or
   explicitly, to either deny or permit the requested access," and the
   default when nothing matches is deny, not permit-by-omission.
   source: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html

2. When granting a permission, require that it be explicitly
   justifiable — "one should be able to explicitly justify why a
   specific permission was granted" — rather than granting broad
   defaults and trimming later; broad-then-trim reliably leaves
   over-grants unnoticed. source:
   https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html

3. When the system has few, stable, non-overlapping roles, choose
   RBAC — it is the simplest model to reason about and audit under
   that condition. source:
   https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html

4. When access depends on dynamic context (multi-tenant ownership, time
   of day, device posture) rather than a fixed role, choose ABAC/ReBAC
   over RBAC — "ABAC greatly expands both the number and type of
   characteristics that can be considered," and RBAC forced into this
   shape produces role explosion. source:
   https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html

5. When a multi-tenant resource is being modeled, do not reuse a
   single-tenant RBAC role set — "RBAC is poorly suited for use cases
   where distinct organizations or customers will need access,"
   because a role alone cannot express "this instance belongs to
   org X." source:
   https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html

6. When an authorization check currently exists only in client-side
   code (hidden UI elements, disabled buttons), **REMOVE** reliance on
   that check and add a server-side (or gateway/serverless-function)
   enforcement point — "access control checks must be performed
   server-side... client-side validation... is often easy to bypass."
   source: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authorization_Cheat_Sheet.html

7. When an endpoint is reachable through more than one entry path (REST
   handler, AJAX handler, internal server-to-server call), apply the
   same permission check on every path — "permission should be
   validated correctly on every request, regardless of whether the
   request was initiated by an AJAX script, server-side, or any other
   source." An endpoint that special-cases one entry path as
   "internal, trusted" is the recurring root cause behind CWE-862.

8. When a role accumulates permissions over time through incremental
   grants (a new feature adds "just one more" permission to an existing
   role), periodically audit and **REMOVE** grants no longer justifiable
   under rule 2 — role explosion and permission creep are the same
   failure observed at different time scales, and neither self-corrects
   without an explicit removal pass. source:
