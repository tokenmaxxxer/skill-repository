# Failure handling — decision rules

Condition → choice → source. Each rule is `addition` or `**REMOVAL**`.

## Trigger

Apply this skill when classifying a pipeline failure as transient
(backoff retry) vs permanent (DLQ) vs ambiguous (bounded retry then
DLQ), setting DLQ volume/aging alert thresholds, diagnosing a failure
via replay success rate, scaling a recovery-time target to business
criticality, rolling back a bad load, handling DLQ overflow during a
cascading failure, or choosing a source-read mechanism to avoid a
failure precursor. This is distinct from data-quality (authoring
completeness/uniqueness/accuracy/freshness checks) and from
pipeline-design (ETL/ELT pattern, idempotency-pattern, and ownership
decisions) — this skill is about how a pipeline detects, classifies,
alerts on, and recovers from failure, not about defining checks or
designing the pipeline's structure.

## Procedure

1. Classify the failure: transient errors get exponential-backoff
   retry, permanent errors go straight to the DLQ, and ambiguous
   errors get one or two bounded retries before falling back to the
   DLQ (rules 1-3).
2. Isolate a bad record to the DLQ and keep processing the rest of
   the batch rather than stopping the whole pipeline on one failure
   (rule 4).
3. Alert on DLQ volume spikes and on DLQ message aging as two
   separate signals, not one combined check (rules 5-6).
4. After applying a fix, verify it by checking reprocessing/replay
   success rate, not just whether the DLQ drained (rule 7).
5. Scale the recovery-time target and escalation path to the
   pipeline's business criticality rather than applying one blanket
   RTO (rule 8).
6. Roll back a bad load by re-running the idempotent partition/window
   load rather than hand-patching the destination table (rule 9).
7. During a cascading failure, route DLQ overflow to dedicated
   capacity instead of overloading the shared DLQ path (rule 10).
8. Retire runbook steps a later fix made structurally dead, and
   collapse redundant retry tiers down to one policy per real error
   class (rules 11-12).
9. Prefer log-based CDC over scheduled polling to remove a
   source-side failure precursor at its root (rule 13).

## Output shape

A failure-handling decision: the applicable rule number(s), the
failure classification or alert/escalation action taken, and the
recovery mechanism used.

1. When a failure is transient (network timeout, HTTP 429/503), retry
   with exponential backoff (e.g. 2^attempt seconds) rather than either
   failing immediately or retrying at a fixed interval. **addition**

2. When a failure is permanent (schema violation, malformed record,
   business-rule violation), route the record straight to a dead-letter
   queue instead of retrying it — retrying a permanent failure just
   burns time and delays the rest of the batch. **addition**

3. When an error's transient-vs-permanent classification is ambiguous,
   retry once or twice with a short backoff and, if it still fails,
   treat it as permanent and route to the DLQ — don't retry indefinitely
   on an unclassified error. **addition**

4. When a record fails processing, write it to the DLQ and continue
   processing the rest of the batch, rather than stopping the whole
   pipeline on one bad record — one malformed record should not block
   the other 99.9%. **addition**

5. When DLQ volume for a source exceeds ~5% of that source's main
   traffic volume, alert on it as a systemic-issue signal, not just log
   it — a rising DLQ rate usually means an upstream contract broke, not
   that individual records are randomly bad. **addition**

6. When a DLQ message has sat unprocessed past its retention window
   (e.g. 24 hours), alert on it separately from the volume-spike alert —
   an aging DLQ message means it will be lost, not just delayed.

7. When diagnosing a pipeline failure, check reprocessing/replay success
   rate after a fix (e.g. alert if replay success < 80%), not just
   whether the DLQ drained — a low replay success rate means the fix
   didn't actually address the root cause. **addition**

8. When setting a recovery-time target for a failure mode, scale it to
   business impact: business-critical/aggregation-sensitive pipelines
   (billing, fraud detection, inventory) get a tight RTO (minutes-to-
   low-single-digit-hours) with paged escalation; non-critical batch
   pipelines get a looser RTO (next business day) with ticket-only
   escalation — don't apply one blanket RTO to every pipeline.

9. When recovering from a bad load, roll back by re-running the
   idempotent load for the affected partition/window (per the
   pipeline-design axis's overwrite-partition or upsert pattern) rather
   than hand-patching the destination table — hand-patches drift from
   what the pipeline would actually produce on rerun. **addition**

10. When cascading failures spike DLQ write volume far above normal
    (e.g. 500x), route that overflow to dedicated DLQ partitions/
    consumer groups instead of overloading the shared DLQ path — a
    shared under-provisioned DLQ becomes the next outage. **addition**
    source: [FlowFuse — Stop silent pipeline failures with DLQ and retries](https://flowfuse.com/blog/2026/03/how-to-implement-dlq-and-retries/)

11. When an escalation runbook step exists for a failure mode that a
    later idempotency/DLQ fix made structurally impossible (e.g. a
    manual "re-run by hand" step for a failure class now auto-recovered
    by replay), delete that runbook step instead of leaving it as dead
    instructions an on-call engineer might still follow. **REMOVAL**

12. When a retry policy has accumulated more retry tiers than the error
    taxonomy actually distinguishes (e.g. 3 separate retry configs for
    what is really one transient-error class), collapse them to one
    policy per real error class rather than keeping the extra tiers
    "for safety." **REMOVAL**

13. When a source system cannot tolerate the read load of repeated
    full-table polling for change detection, capture changes by
    reading the source's own transaction/commit log instead of polling
    it on a schedule — this removes a failure precursor at its root
    (source-side read-load degradation caused by the ingestion
    mechanism itself) rather than tuning the polling interval to
    reduce it. This is a distinct failure-mode design axis from the
    transient/permanent retry classification above (items 1-3): it is
    about preventing a source-side failure mode, not classifying one
    after it happens. **addition**
