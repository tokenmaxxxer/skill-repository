# JTBD problem framing (fixing the problem before any solution)

Research trail: Jobs-to-be-Done canon (Tony Ulwick/Strategyn ODI method, Clayton Christensen's "hire a solution" framing) fetched this session via UXtweak, Strategyn, Hotjar, and Coursera summaries; cross-checked for the four-part tuple (job performer, job statement, circumstance, desired outcome) and the solution-free job-statement rule.

## Trigger

Apply this skill whenever a problem statement, issue, or feature request
is being written or reviewed, especially when the incoming text already
names a tool or mechanism — the job statement must be fixed in
solution-free form before evaluating any named solution.

## Procedure

1. Write the problem as a job statement (verb + object + clarifier),
   never naming a tool or feature (rule 1), and name the specific job
   performer, not "users" generically (rule 2).
2. If the request already names a solution, restate the problem in
   job-statement form first, before evaluating that solution (rule 3).
3. Record the circumstance as the triggering condition and situational
   constraints (rule 4), and phrase each desired outcome as a
   measurable success criterion, kept as a list of independently
   measurable criteria rather than one collapsed statement (rules 5, 7).
4. Fix all four tuple elements (performer, job, circumstance, outcome)
   before proceeding to solution comparison (rule 6); when a stakeholder
   asserts "the solution is obviously X," redirect to which job X serves
   (rule 8).
5. Strip any UI/technology/mechanism reference from the problem
   statement itself (rule 9), and delete any justification clause that
   trails a circumstance description into a specific fix (rule 10).

## Output shape

A solution-free job statement (performer, job, circumstance, one or
more measurable desired outcomes), with any named solution or
justification clause removed from the problem section and preserved
separately if needed.

## Rules

1. When writing a problem statement for any issue or feature request, express it as a job statement in the pattern verb + object + clarifier/context ("restore my home to a safe, clean state quickly after a spill, without harsh odors") and never as a named tool or feature — the job statement must stay solution-free by definition, so if the sentence names a UI, a button, or a specific mechanism, it is not yet a job statement. source: https://www.uxtweak.com/jobs-to-be-done/framework/

2. When identifying who the problem belongs to, name the job performer as the specific role or actor executing the job (not "users" generically) — job executors are "the people who are actively getting a specific task done," so a proposal that says "improve the experience for users" without naming which actor is mid-job has not located the job performer. source: https://umbrex.com/resources/frameworks/organization-frameworks/jobs-to-be-done-framework/

3. When a requester's issue text already names a tool, mechanism, or feature (a solution), restate the problem in job-statement form BEFORE evaluating that solution — the core functional job must be defined in a single, solution-free statement first, so committing to the named solution before that restatement risks anchoring the fix to the wrong job. source: https://www.uxtweak.com/jobs-to-be-done/framework/

4. When capturing the situation around a job, record the circumstance as the triggering condition and the situational constraints under which the job arises (not a generic "in general" context) — circumstances are "situational and/or conditional factors that motivate customers to want to get jobs done" and "heavily influence which solutions are most suitable," so two performers with the same job statement but different circumstances can require different solutions. source: https://digitalleadership.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/

5. When writing the desired outcome, phrase it as a measurable success criterion the performer uses to judge progress (e.g. "minimize time to X," "reduce likelihood of Y," "increase confidence that Z holds") rather than as a feature wish — desired outcomes are defined as "measurable ways customers judge success," so an outcome stated as "I want a dashboard" is a solution wish, not a desired outcome, and must be rewritten. source: https://www.uxtweak.com/jobs-to-be-done/framework/

6. When the four tuple elements (performer, job, circumstance, outcome) are not all fixed before any solution is proposed, treat the survey as incomplete and do not proceed to solution comparison — the JTBD logic is that customers "hire" solutions to make progress on a job, in a context, toward desired outcomes; skipping straight to a solution without first fixing all four collapses the framework into solution-first thinking it exists to prevent. source: https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/

7. When multiple desired outcomes are surfaced for one job, keep them as a list of independently measurable criteria rather than collapsing them into one vague success statement — desired outcomes are enumerable and prioritizable (this is the basis for ODI-style outcome-driven prioritization), so merging them removes the ability to later score which outcome the chosen solution actually serves. source: https://strategyn.com/jobs-to-be-done/

8. When a stakeholder proposes "the solution is obviously X," redirect the conversation to which job X purports to serve and what circumstance makes X necessary — the framework's core claim is that customers hire solutions for progress on a job, not that they want the solution itself, so a solution proposed with no traceable job is unverifiable against this framework. source: https://umbrex.com/resources/frameworks/strategy-frameworks/jobs-to-be-done-framework/

9. **REMOVAL**: When drafting a current-state survey's problem section, strip any sentence that names a UI element, a technology, an API, or a specific mechanism from the problem statement itself — move that content to a separate "solution being considered" note if it must be preserved, because leaving it embedded in the problem statement silently re-introduces the solution-first bias JTBD framing is meant to remove. source: https://www.uxtweak.com/jobs-to-be-done/framework/

10. **REMOVAL**: When a circumstance description trails into justification for a specific fix ("...so we should add a toggle"), delete the justification clause and keep only the situational trigger — circumstances describe when/why the job arises, not what to build in response; conflating the two lets a favored solution smuggle itself back into the "problem" section under cover of context. source: https://digitalleadership.com/blog/jobs-to-be-done/
