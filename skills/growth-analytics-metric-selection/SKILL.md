# One-metric-that-matters selection rules

## Trigger

Apply this skill when a team is choosing what to call its North Star /
one metric that matters for its current business stage, or when a
record proposes more than one metric flagged as the live North Star for
the same review window.

## Procedure

1. When choosing the North Star / one metric that matters, pick the
   single metric tied to the stage's current bottleneck, not the metric
   that is easiest to move, and revisit the choice as the stage changes
   (rule 1).
2. When more than one metric is proposed as `is_north_star=true` for the
   same review window, cut all but one (rule 2).

## Output shape

Exactly one live North Star metric, tied to the current stage's
bottleneck, with any competing candidates removed.

1. **When** a team is choosing what to call the North Star / one metric
   that matters for a given business stage, **pick the single metric
   tied to the stage's current bottleneck, not the metric that is
   easiest to move** — OMTM selection is stage-dependent (the right
   metric for an empathy-stage product differs from a growth-stage
   product) and must be revisited as the stage changes, not fixed once.

2. **REMOVAL** — when a record proposes more than one metric as
   `is_north_star=true` for the same review window, **cut all but one**;
   the recomputation rule forces exactly one live North Star because a
   set of "several KPIs" prevents anyone from knowing which number the
   org will actually act on.
