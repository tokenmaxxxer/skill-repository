# Verification method selection

Picking HOW a requirement gets checked — inspection, analysis, demonstration,
or test — before picking a verdict. Wrong method choice produces a verdict
that looks rigorous but didn't actually check the claim.

## Trigger

Apply this skill when picking how a requirement gets checked —
inspection, analysis, demonstration, or test — before picking a verdict.

## Procedure

1. Use Inspection for a structural/static property — a field exists, a
   schema shape, a file present at a path — rather than running the code
   (rule 1).
2. Use Analysis, not a happy-path demonstration, when the requirement
   concerns behavior under conditions the review session cannot
   realistically reproduce (rule 2).
3. Use Demonstration for a qualitative functional claim, exercising the
   actual flow with representative stimuli rather than inferring
   behavior from the code (rule 3).
4. When a requirement already has an executable test in the repo, reuse
   it as the Test-method evidence rather than re-deriving a parallel
   manual check (rule 4).
5. When a requirement has a recorded, replayable interaction fixture,
   prefer replaying it over re-reading prose documentation, treating a
   passing replay as Test-method evidence per rule 4 (rule 5).

## Output shape

One verification method — Inspection, Analysis, Demonstration, or Test —
selected per requirement's own nature before a verdict is rendered, with
existing tests and recorded fixtures reused rather than duplicated.

## Rules

1. **When** the requirement concerns a structural/static property of the
   artifact (a field exists, a schema shape, a file is present at a path),
   **use Inspection** (read/compare against the spec) rather than running the
   code — inspection is defined for exactly this "what is required vs. what is
   present" comparison and is cheaper and more reliable here than execution.

   29148-2018](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/29148-2018.html))

2. **When** the requirement concerns behavior under conditions the review
   session cannot realistically reproduce (load, timing, a production-only
   integration), **use Analysis** (trace the code path / reason from a model)
   instead of asserting Present from a demonstration that only exercised the
   happy path — a demonstration under artificial conditions does not establish
   the requirement under the conditions actually named. source: 29148 defines
   Analysis as the method for cases "testing to realistic conditions cannot be
   achieved or is not cost-effective." ([IEEE SA: 29148-2018](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/29148-2018.html))

3. **When** the requirement is a qualitative functional claim ("the form
   submits and shows a confirmation"), **use Demonstration** — exercise the
   actual flow with representative stimuli rather than reading the code and
   inferring behavior; code that looks correct can still fail to run. source:
   29148 Demonstration = "qualitative exhibition of functional performance...
   with system stimuli...to show system or system element response is
   suitable." ([IEEE SA: 29148-2018](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/29148-2018.html))

4. **When** a requirement has an executable test already in the repo that
   claims to cover it, **do not re-derive a fresh verification method** —
   reuse the existing test as the Test-method evidence and cite its run
   output; re-deriving a parallel manual check for something already
   test-covered duplicates effort without raising confidence. (removal)
   source: 29148's four-method taxonomy treats Test as a first-class method on
   par with the other three — an existing automated Test result is not
   downgraded to Inspection merely because a human is doing the review.
   ([IEEE SA: 29148-2018](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/29148-2018.html))

5. **When** a requirement already has a recorded, replayable interaction
   fixture that both the requesting and the satisfying side of the
   requirement can be checked against (a captured request/response pair, a
   golden snapshot, a recorded message exchange), **prefer replaying that
   fixture over re-reading prose documentation to judge conformance** — a
   replay either matches or it doesn't, while a prose comparison depends on
   the reviewer's own interpretation of ambiguous wording. Treat a passing
   replay as Test-method evidence per rule 4, not as a fresh Inspection.
