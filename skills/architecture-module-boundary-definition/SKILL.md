# Module Boundary Definition

Operational decision rules for where to draw a module/component/service boundary:
cohesion criteria, what belongs together, and — just as important — when to stop
splitting and merge things back. Sourced from practitioner writeups (layer 1),
named methodologies (layer 2), and academic/theoretical grounding (layer 3).

Where sources conflict — most sharply "always favor small, single-purpose
services" (microservices advocacy) vs. "avoid premature decomposition, start
monolith-first" (Fowler, and the growing body of monolith-reversion case
studies) — the conflict is called out explicitly in the affected rules rather
than silently picking a side.

## Trigger

Apply this skill when placing or auditing a module/component/service
boundary: deciding what belongs together, whether a proposed split
should happen at all, whether an existing split should be merged back,
or whether a boundary diagram is trustworthy enough to review against.

## Procedure

1. Draw the boundary so a likely-to-change design decision is hidden
   entirely inside one module (rule 1); never decompose purely by
   processing step/technical layer — keep those steps together unless a
   real hidden-decision boundary separates them (rule 2); organize by
   domain concept, not technical role (rule 3).
2. Require every cross-component interaction to go through an explicit
   public interface, treating direct data reach-through as a violation
   to fix (rule 4); use bounded contexts — where the ubiquitous language
   changes — as the seam, not database schemas (rule 5).
3. When decomposing a newly identified bounded context, model it as one
   service first and only split further once a concrete need
   (independent scaling, ownership, deploy cadence) appears (rule 6);
   for a new system, build a monolith first and defer service
   boundaries until real usage reveals the seams (rule 7).
4. Merge over-decomposed services back together when each is thin and
   mostly passes calls through (rule 8); merge two services back into
   one when their boundary no longer hides an independent design
   decision (rule 9); redraw the boundary to match a single team's
   ownership, or restructure teams via reverse-Conway, rather than
   leaving a boundary that forces permanent cross-team coordination
   (rule 10).
5. Split a module along the seam where cohesion changes from
   functional/sequential to coincidental/logical — never solely because
   line count crossed a threshold (rule 11); conversely, leave a large
   but low-coupling, internally-cohesive module as one module rather
   than splitting to satisfy a size guideline (rule 12).
6. When a boundary discussion conflates deployable-unit and
   internal-code-organization questions, separate them: pick container
   boundaries from ownership/scaling/deploy-cadence needs first, then
   component boundaries from cohesion inside each container (rule 13).
7. When two boundary placements both seem plausible, prefer the one
   that isolates the assumption most likely to change, not the one that
   merely looks tidier (rule 14).
8. When a C4-level boundary diagram exists only as a pasted image,
   produce it instead from a single text-based model checked into the
   record's write scope so it diffs like code (rule 15).

## Output shape

A boundary decision: keep-together / split / merge-back, the rule
number(s) applied, the cohesion or bounded-context justification, and
— where a REMOVAL rule fires (8, 9, 12) — what gets merged or left
unsplit.

### 1. Hide a design decision likely to change
- condition: a design decision (data format, algorithm, storage choice) is likely to change during the system's life and multiple modules would otherwise need to know about it
- choice: pick the module boundary so that decision is hidden entirely inside one module, exposing only a stable interface
- why: information hiding is the original, still-canonical criterion for where a module boundary should fall — not "flowchart" step order
- source: https://wstomv.win.tue.nl/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf

### 2. Do not decompose by processing step / technical layer
- condition: a team is tempted to draw a module boundary between parsing/validation/storage/output stages of one process
- choice: keep those steps in one module unless a real hidden-decision boundary separates them; do not split purely by flowchart phase
- why: Parnas showed step-by-step decomposition ("classical" decomposition) produces modules that all break together when the shared assumption changes, defeating the point of a boundary
- source: https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/09/05/on-the-criteria-to-be-used-in-decomposing-systems-into-modules/

### 3. Organize components by domain concept, not technical role
- condition: defining component boundaries in a large application (e.g. Rails-style app with models/views/controllers spanning many business areas)
- choice: split components along real-world business concepts (orders, shipping, inventory, billing), each owning its own data, instead of along MVC-style technical layers
- why: Shopify's modular-monolith retrofit found domain-organized boundaries are what let 100+ engineers work without stepping on each other; layer-organized boundaries didn't reduce coupling
- source: https://shopify.engineering/deconstructing-monolith-designing-software-maximizes-developer-productivity

### 4. Give every component exactly one public interface and forbid direct data reach-through
- condition: two components need to interact with each other's state
- choice: require the interaction go through an explicit public API; treat any cross-component association or direct data access as a boundary violation to fix, not a shortcut to allow
- why: Shopify's enforcement tooling (Wedge/Packwerk) found that "just this once" cross-component field access is precisely what erodes a boundary until it's fictional
- source: https://shopify.engineering/deconstructing-monolith-designing-software-maximizes-developer-productivity

### 5. Use bounded contexts, not database schemas, as the seam
- condition: decomposing an existing monolith and looking for where the seams should be
- choice: identify bounded contexts by where the ubiquitous language changes (the same word means a different thing to different teams), and place the boundary there rather than at a table or schema line
- why: Evans/Fowler's DDD guidance treats a bounded context as defined by a consistent model and language, which is a better predictor of a durable boundary than storage layout
- source: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html

### 6. Model the whole bounded context as one service first (REMOVAL applies at finer grain)
- condition: decomposing a monolith into services around a newly identified bounded context
- choice: keep the whole bounded context as a single service initially; only split it further into smaller services around aggregates later, and only if a concrete need (independent scaling, ownership, deploy cadence) appears
- why: Sam Newman's guidance is to minimize the number of services at first cut — over-splitting on day one is harder to reverse than splitting later from evidence
- source: https://eddmann.com/posts/notes-monolith-to-microservices-by-sam-newman/

### 7. Do not decompose into services before the domain model is understood
- condition: a new system is being designed from scratch and there is pressure to start with a microservices architecture "to avoid a rewrite later"
- choice: build it as a monolith first; defer service-boundary decomposition until real usage has revealed where the seams actually are
- why: Fowler's MonolithFirst observation — almost all successful microservice systems started as monoliths that outgrew a boundary, while systems built as microservices from day one tend toward serious trouble because premature boundaries get drawn in the wrong place and are expensive to move
- source: https://martinfowler.com/articles/break-monolith-into-microservices.html

### 8. CONFLICT — reconcile "many small services" advice against "avoid premature decomposition" **REMOVAL**
- condition: a team already has more services than its current team/traffic can justify, each one thin and mostly passing calls through to another (a "distributed monolith")
- choice: merge over-decomposed services back into fewer, coarser-grained ones until each surviving boundary corresponds to an independently-changing, independently-owned concern; do not keep a split alive just because "smaller services are best practice"
- why: this directly resolves the conflict between microservices advocacy (small, single-purpose services) and Fowler/Newman's monolith-first caution — the resolution favored here is Fowler's: a split earns its keep only when it removes real coupling, and if it doesn't, undo it; InVision, Amazon Prime Video's monitoring service, and Istio's control plane all reverted splits for this reason

### 9. Merge a service back when its boundary no longer hides anything **REMOVAL**
- condition: two services always deploy together, share a release train, and neither can change its interface without the other changing in lockstep the same day
- choice: merge them into one module/service and delete the network boundary between them
- why: a boundary that no longer hides an independent design decision (Parnas's own test) is pure overhead — network hops, retries, and duplicated ops burden with none of the benefit
- source: https://wstomv.win.tue.nl/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf

### 10. Let team communication boundaries and reverse-Conway maneuvers set the boundary, not vice versa
- condition: a proposed module boundary requires two teams to coordinate on every change (constant cross-team PRs, shared release windows)
- choice: either redraw the module boundary to match a single team's ownership, or restructure the teams to match the desired architecture (reverse-Conway) — do not leave a boundary standing that forces permanent cross-team synchronization
- why: MIT/HBS research on the mirroring hypothesis found system modularity closely tracks organizational coupling; a boundary fighting the org chart stays leaky regardless of how it's documented
- source: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html

### 11. Split a module when its cohesion type is coincidental or logical, not when it merely feels "big"
- condition: a module's internal functions are grouped only by being triggered at the same time, or by superficial similarity (e.g. "all the utility functions"), rather than by contributing to one well-defined task
- choice: split the module along the seam where cohesion changes from functional/sequential to coincidental/logical; do not split solely because line count crossed an arbitrary threshold
- why: Stevens/Myers/Constantine's structured-design cohesion taxonomy (coincidental through functional) is the original, still-cited criterion distinguishing a boundary that improves maintainability from one that's cosmetic
- source: https://mrpicky.dev/a-brief-history-of-coupling-and-cohesion/

### 12. Don't split further just because a module is large — check coupling first **REMOVAL**
- condition: a module is large by line count or file count but has low coupling to the rest of the system and its internals change together as a unit
- choice: leave it as one module; do not split it merely to satisfy a size guideline
- why: coupling/cohesion research (and later replications) found size alone is a weak and sometimes misleading quality indicator — splitting a cohesive-but-large module can raise coupling and hurt maintainability rather than help it
- source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00590439

### 13. Use C4 container/component levels to decide which granularity a "boundary" question is even about
- condition: a discussion about "where the boundary should go" is stalling because participants are conflating a deployable-unit decision (container level) with an internal-code-organization decision (component level)
- choice: separate the two: pick container boundaries (independently deployable units — services, databases) first from ownership/scaling/deploy-cadence needs, then pick component boundaries (internal groupings behind an interface) inside each container from cohesion — don't force one decision to answer both questions
- why: the C4 model's explicit level separation exists because conflating "what deploys separately" with "what's grouped behind an interface" produces boundaries that are wrong at one level to satisfy the other
- source: https://c4model.com/

### 14. Draw the boundary where a difficult-to-predict change is most likely to land
- condition: two plausible boundary placements exist and it's unclear which is more "correct"
- choice: prefer the placement that isolates the assumption most likely to change (data source, third-party API, regulatory rule) inside a single module, over the placement that merely looks tidier structurally
- why: Parnas's central finding — decomposition driven by anticipated change, not by current structure, is what actually reduces the cost of the next modification
- source: https://wstomv.win.tue.nl/edu/2ip30/references/criteria_for_modularization.pdf

### 15. A C4-level boundary diagram exists only as a pasted image, not as a versioned model
- condition: a container/component boundary diagram for a decision record is a screenshot or hand-drawn image pasted into the record, with no text source a reviewer can diff against the prior version
- choice: produce the diagram from a single text-based model (one DSL/model file that generates the context/container/component views), and check that source into the record's write scope so the diagram diffs like code across revisions; do not treat a hand-maintained image as satisfying the C4-diagram requirement
- why: an image can silently drift from the actual decision with no reviewable diff; a single text model generating multiple views also keeps the context/container/component levels (rule 13) consistent with each other by construction instead of being drawn independently and drifting apart
