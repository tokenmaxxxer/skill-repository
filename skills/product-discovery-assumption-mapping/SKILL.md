name: product-discovery-assumption-mapping
description: >-
  Use this skill when a candidate solution needs to be decomposed into testable assumptions, or whenever the agent is about to draft
  interview questions at that point. Trigger it right after `scoping to researching`,
  on requests like "가정 맵 만들어줘", "map the assumptions behind this idea", "which assumptions
  are riskiest", "plot evidence strength vs importance". It plots each assumption on the 2x2
  evidence-strength x importance grid across
  desirability/viability/feasibility/usability/ethical and picks assumption-test types for
  the critical+weak quadrant. Do NOT use it to write the hypothesis statement itself or move
  product-cycle state (use product-discovery-hypothesis-testing).

# Assumption mapping for `researching`

**Stage:** `researching`.

**What it asks the user for** (or derives from interview evidence already
on file): candidate assumptions underlying the idea, across Teresa
Torres's five categories (per
`docs/reports/research/2026-07-27-role-practice/product.md`):

1. **Desirability** — do customers actually want this?
2. **Viability** — does the business benefit?
3. **Feasibility** — can it be built?
4. **Usability** — can customers use it?
5. **Ethical** — could it cause harm?

For each assumption gathered, ask (or infer from evidence on file) two
ratings:

- **Evidence strength**: weak -> strong.
- **Importance**: less critical -> critical.

**What it produces:** an assumption map — a 2x2 grid (evidence strength ×
importance) with each assumption plotted as a point. Assumptions landing in
the critical + weak-evidence quadrant become the priority test list, each
tagged with which of the four assumption-test types will be used to test
it: prototype test, one-question survey, data mining, or engineering
spike.

**Where it is written:** `product/assumption-map.md` — a plain artifact
write, not the role record. Never gated.

**Field list**, per assumption row:

- Assumption text
- Category (desirability / viability / feasibility / usability / ethical)
- Evidence strength (weak / medium / strong)
- Importance (less critical / critical)
- Quadrant (derived: critical+weak = priority)
- Assumption-test type chosen, if in the priority quadrant (prototype
  test / one-question survey / data mining / engineering spike)

## Trigger

Apply this skill when the product role is in the `researching` state and
needs to decompose a candidate solution into testable assumptions, or
whenever the agent is about to draft interview questions while in this
state — distinct from writing the hypothesis statement itself, which
happens once a top-quadrant assumption has enough evidence.

## Procedure

1. Ask the user for candidate assumptions across the five Torres
   categories, one category at a time, or pull them from interview
   evidence already on file (see `## How to run the conversation`).
2. For each assumption, ask for or propose its evidence-strength and
   importance ratings, and write each row into `product/assumption-map.md`
   as you go, not batched at the end (see `## How to run the
   conversation`).
3. Any time interview questions are about to be drafted, inject the Mom
   Test's three rules first, and discard compliments, hypotheticals, and
   feature wishlists as unreliable answers (see `## Standing directive:
   the Mom Test`).
4. Cite every evidence entry to a concrete source (file path, commit
   sha, named interview record) — never a bare claim (see
   `## `evidence_log``).
5. Once assumptions are plotted, name which fall in the critical +
   weak-evidence quadrant, propose which to test first and with which
   test type, and hand off to `hypothesis-testing` and `guardrail-metrics`
   once enough evidence exists (see `## How to run the conversation`).

## Output shape

An assumption map in `product/assumption-map.md`: one row per
assumption (text, category, evidence strength, importance, derived
quadrant, assumption-test type if priority), each evidence citation
resolving to a concrete source.

## `evidence_log`

Every one-line evidence citation this skill already writes (interview/
observation count, date, paraphrase) *is* `product-discovery.spec.json`'s
`evidence_log` field — no separate log or artifact is needed. Each
citation resolves to a concrete source: a file path, a commit sha, or a
named interview record — never a bare claim with nothing behind it. This
repository already follows a `reference_resolution` rule as an unwritten
convention (no orphan references: a citation that cannot be traced to a
path/sha/source is not written into the assumption map); this section
makes that rule explicit so `evidence_log` and reference resolution are
documented, not just practiced.

## Standing directive: the Mom Test

Any time this skill (or the agent generally, while in `researching`) is
about to draft interview questions, inject these three rules before
drafting them, regardless of interview format (continuous discovery or
JTBD switch interview):

1. Ask about the customer's life and past behavior, not their opinion of
   your idea.
2. Ask about specifics that already happened, not hypotheticals about the
   future.
3. The interviewer should talk no more than roughly 20% of the time —
   let the customer carry the conversation.

Treat three kinds of answers as unreliable and discard them rather than
recording them as evidence: compliments, hypothetical "I would..."
statements, and feature wishlists.

## How to run the conversation

1. Ask the user to name candidate assumptions, one category at a time
   (desirability, then viability, then feasibility, then usability, then
   ethical) — or pull them from interview notes already on file if the
   user points you at them.
2. For each assumption, ask for (or propose, from evidence) its evidence
   strength and importance rating.
3. Write each assumption as a row in `product/assumption-map.md` as you go
   — do not batch all of it into one write at the end.
4. Once assumptions are plotted, tell the user which ones fall in the
   critical + weak-evidence quadrant and propose which to test first, and
   with which of the four test types.
5. When enough evidence exists on the priority assumption(s), move to
   drafting the hypothesis statement ("We believe / we will know" — see
   the existing `hypothesis-testing` skill) and hand off to
   `guardrail-metrics` before `researching to hypothesis-registered`.

## Common mistakes this skill exists to prevent

- Treating a compliment, an "I would use that," or a feature request as
  evidence for an assumption's strength.
- Skipping straight to a hypothesis before any assumption has been mapped.
- Letting the agent talk more than the customer when drafting or running
  interview questions in this state.
