# Headroom-band sizing and degradation-risk shape

Research trail: Neil J. Gunther's Universal Scalability Law (USL), X(N) = γN / (1 + α(N-1) + βN(N-1)) — Performance Dynamics' "How to Quantify Scalability" and the CRAN `usl` package vignette, both fetched this session; Amdahl's-Law-derived scalability-limit literature (Steinacker) as secondary framing.

## Trigger

Apply this skill when reporting a resource's headroom, assessing its
degradation-risk shape as it approaches a scaling ceiling, applying
the Universal Scalability Law's alpha/beta terms, or defining a
fallback trigger for when the predictive headroom band's forecast
turns out to be wrong.

## Procedure

1. Report headroom as a band (current % and shrink rate over the
   forecast horizon) rather than a single snapshot, always paired with
   the forecast horizon it was computed over (rule 1, rule 6).
2. Account for USL's alpha (contention) term, which creates a hard
   ceiling before beta-driven degradation kicks in (rule 2).
3. Account for USL's beta (coherency) term when cross-node consistency
   work is present, keeping the safe band below Nmax rather than only
   below raw exhaustion (rule 3).
4. When beta is negligible (no cross-node coordination), size the band
   around the alpha-driven asymptote instead of applying the retrograde
   framing (rule 4).
5. Treat an accelerating shrink rate as its own trigger signal,
   distinct from the flat threshold in the expansion-trigger axis
   (rule 5).
6. Do not extrapolate from an ideal linear-speedup (Amdahl) assumption
   once contention/coherency effects are observable in load-test data
   (rule 7).
7. When USL parameters cannot be fit (no multi-concurrency load-test
   data), state the degradation shape as unmeasured and widen
   safety_buffer instead of fabricating a curve (rule 8), and drop
   USL fitting for a resource that shows genuinely linear scaling
   (rule 10) — never keep reporting the old snapshot-only format once a
   band-plus-horizon format is adopted (rule 9).
8. Pair a predictive headroom band with a reactive fallback trigger
   keyed to live observed utilization, stating what action it takes if
   actual usage outruns the band before the next forecast cycle
   (rule 11), and name the specific owner and escalation path that
   acts on that fallback trigger (rule 12).

## Output shape

A headroom record stated as a band with shrink rate and forecast
horizon, its degradation shape justified by USL alpha/beta terms (or
explicitly flagged unmeasured), paired with a reactive fallback
trigger and a named owner/escalation path.

## Rules

1. When reporting how much room a resource has before it becomes a capacity risk, report it as a band (current headroom % and the rate at which that headroom is shrinking over the forecast horizon) rather than a single snapshot number — USL models throughput as degrading non-linearly (not linearly) as load approaches the system's limit, so a snapshot at one instant cannot show whether the system is near the shallow or the steep part of that curve. source: https://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html

2. When a resource's scaling behavior includes contention for a shared resource (locks, connection pools, shared queues), account for USL's alpha (contention) term when projecting headroom — alpha alone creates a horizontal asymptote (a hard ceiling on maximum throughput) even before beta-driven degradation kicks in, so a headroom projection that only tracks linear capacity added ignores a real ceiling the system can approach well before "100% utilized" in a naive sense. source: https://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html

3. When a resource's scaling behavior includes cross-node data consistency work (cache coherence, distributed consensus, replication), account for USL's beta (coherency) term — beta is the only term that makes throughput actively retrograde (decline) past a load point, at Nmax = sqrt((1-alpha)/beta), so for beta>0 systems the safe headroom band must stay below Nmax, not just below "resource exhaustion," because past Nmax adding load makes things worse, not merely stagnant. source: https://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html

4. When beta (coherency cost) is zero or negligible for a resource (no cross-node coordination, e.g. independently-shardable stateless workers), the headroom curve flattens to an asymptote rather than turning over — in that case size the band around the alpha-driven ceiling, and do not apply the beta-driven "retrograde past Nmax" framing, since a wrong degradation shape (assuming decline when the real shape is a plateau) misdirects the expansion trigger timing. source: https://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html

5. When a headroom band shows the shrink rate accelerating (the gap between current usage and the ceiling closing faster over successive forecast periods, characteristic of nearing an alpha/beta-driven degradation zone), treat that acceleration itself as a trigger signal distinct from the raw threshold-crossing trigger in the expansion-trigger axis — a linear-looking usage trend can still be approaching a non-linear USL ceiling, so a headroom-band record must flag curve acceleration even when the flat percentage threshold hasn't fired yet.

6. When a capacity record cites a headroom percentage, always pair it with the forecast horizon over which that percentage was computed (e.g. "35% headroom, projected to reach 10% in 6 weeks") — a bare percentage with no horizon cannot distinguish a comfortably slow-shrinking band from a fast-closing one, which is the exact distinction the band framing exists to preserve. source: https://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html

7. When estimating a system's practical scaling ceiling for headroom purposes, do not extrapolate from an ideal linear-speedup assumption (Amdahl's Law's serial-fraction-only model) once real contention/coherency effects are observable in load-test data — USL was developed specifically because Amdahl's Law's linear framing addresses only the serial-fraction limit and misses the coherency-delay effect that produces the retrograde region, so a headroom estimate built on Amdahl alone will overstate available capacity near the real ceiling. source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_J._Gunther

8. When fitting a resource's own USL parameters (alpha, beta, gamma) is impractical (no load-test data at multiple concurrency levels), do not fabricate a numeric USL fit — state explicitly that the degradation shape is unmeasured and fall back to the flat-threshold trigger from the expansion-trigger axis with a wider safety_buffer term to compensate for the unmodeled non-linearity, rather than presenting an invented USL curve as if it were measured.

9. **REMOVAL**: When a headroom figure has historically been reported as a single "X% capacity remaining" snapshot in a capacity record, stop reporting it that way going forward — drop the snapshot-only format entirely once a band-plus-horizon format is adopted, rather than keeping both in parallel, since a reader defaulting to the old snapshot number reintroduces exactly the false confidence the band format exists to remove. source: https://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html

10. **REMOVAL**: When a resource shows no measurable contention or coherency effect in load-test data (throughput scales linearly across tested concurrency levels), drop USL curve-fitting for that resource's headroom reporting and use a simple linear-capacity-vs-load projection instead — applying the full three-parameter USL model to a genuinely linear-scaling resource adds model complexity with no explanatory benefit and risks fitting noise into a spurious alpha/beta. source: https://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html

11. When a headroom-band record rests on a predictive demand forecast, pair the band with a stated reactive fallback trigger — a secondary threshold keyed to live, observed utilization rather than the forecast — and state what action that fallback takes if actual usage outruns the predicted band before the next forecast cycle; a purely predictive band has no defined recourse for its own forecast error, and the fallback is what keeps a forecast miss from turning into unserved demand before the next scheduled forecast catches it.

12. When rule 11's reactive fallback trigger is stated, name the specific owner and escalation path that acts on it (who is paged, via what channel, running which runbook step), not just the threshold value that fires it — a fallback trigger with no named responder degrades to the same "no defined recourse" gap rule 11 exists to close, just moved one step downstream from "no fallback" to "a fallback nobody is on the hook to act on."
    tool: `observability-monitoring` plugin, `wshobson/agents` (multi-harness Claude Code agent/plugin marketplace; 38,778 GitHub stars — adoption evidence: `gh api repos/wshobson/agents --jq .stargazers_count` executed this session).
    problem: SLI/SLO alerting thresholds and the incident-response path that acts on them are often designed and owned separately, so an alert can fire correctly with no clear responder or runbook to actually close the gap it flags.
    how: the plugin's `observability-engineer` agent bundles alert/threshold definition together with PagerDuty-style routing/escalation and runbook automation as one deliverable, rather than treating threshold design and on-call response as separate concerns.
    learning -> upgrades this axis's rule 11 (pair the band with a reactive fallback trigger): the fallback trigger itself is incomplete without a named owner and escalation channel bundled into the same record, mirroring how the surveyed plugin bundles the threshold and the response path together rather than leaving the response implicit.
