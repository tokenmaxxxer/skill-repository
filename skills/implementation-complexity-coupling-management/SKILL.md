# Complexity / coupling management

Decision rules for keeping module interdependence low and cohesion high,
with a numeric threshold to trigger refactor, plus removal rules for
shedding coupling that already exists.

## Trigger

Apply this skill when writing or reviewing code that touches module
boundaries: a class's CBO or LCOM metric is being evaluated, a caller
chains through an object's internal object, a new feature could either
widen an existing contract or add a new cross-module dependency edge, a
dependency-injection interface or shared "utils" module is under review
for removal, a cross-module import direction is being introduced, or a
local pre-merge check pipeline's tool set or step order is being decided.

## Procedure

1. If evaluating a class's coupling, check its CBO count; at 9, split
   the class or introduce a narrower interface (rule 1).
2. If a caller chains through nested accessors (`a.getB().getC()`),
   restructure to a delegating method instead (rule 2).
3. If evaluating cohesion, check for methods operating on disjoint
   field subsets (high LCOM) and split along that boundary (rule 3).
4. If a new feature could widen an existing contract instead of adding a
   dependency edge, prefer widening the contract (rule 4).
5. If a DI interface has exactly one implementation and no test double
   substitutes a second one, flag it for removal (rule 5).
6. If a shared "utils"/"common" module serves unrelated callers for
   unrelated functions, split it back apart by consumer group (rule 6).
7. If a cross-module import direction is forbidden by the architecture,
   encode it as a checked rule at the point of introduction, not after a
   cycle accumulates (rule 7).
8. If two or more local checks overlap in what they catch, consolidate
   onto the one covering the union (rule 8).
9. If ordering a local pre-merge check pipeline, order cheapest-and-
   narrowest checks first and most-expensive-and-broadest last (rule 9).

## Output shape

A coupling/cohesion decision: the metric or condition that triggered it,
the applicable rule number, and the concrete action (split, restructure,
widen, remove, reorder) to take.

## Rules

1. When a class's Coupling Between Objects (CBO) count — unique classes
   it touches via parameters, locals, return types, calls, field types,
   base classes, or interfaces — reaches 9, treat it as the trigger
   point to split the class or introduce a narrower interface; CBO = 9
   is the documented single-member threshold at which excessive coupling
   is flagged.

2. When a method's public API forces a caller to chain through an
   internal object's internal object (`a.getB().getC().doThing()`),
   restructure to a delegating method on `a` instead — this is the Law
   of Demeter violation to fix, and it exists specifically to bound
   how far coupling knowledge is allowed to travel between modules.

3. When two methods within one class operate on disjoint subsets of that
   class's instance fields (high Lack-of-Cohesion-in-Methods, LCOM),
   split the class along the field-usage boundary — a class whose
   methods don't share state is two classes sharing one file, not one
   cohesive unit.

4. When a new feature can be satisfied by widening an existing module's
   public contract vs. adding a new cross-module dependency edge, prefer
   widening the existing contract — each new dependency edge is a
   permanent coupling cost, and lower coupling is what makes a module
   independently reusable and testable.

5. REMOVAL — when a dependency-injection interface has exactly one
   implementation across the entire codebase AND no test double
   currently substitutes a second implementation through it, delete the
   interface and depend on the concrete type directly; an interface that
   never varies is coupling-shaped ceremony, not coupling reduction. Flag
   this explicitly during review rather than relying on it to be noticed
   — subtractive fixes are the systematically overlooked category.

6. REMOVAL — when a shared "utils"/"common" module has grown so that
   unrelated callers each depend on it for one unrelated function, split
   it back apart by consumer group rather than adding a new function to
   it; a low-cohesion shared module is itself a coupling hazard (every
   caller of the module is transitively coupled to every other caller's
   changes) and the fix is to shrink/delete the shared module, not grow
   it further.

7. When a cross-module import direction is forbidden by the
   architecture (e.g. a lower layer importing from a higher one), encode
   that direction as an explicit, checked rule at the point the import
   is written — do not wait for a full dependency cycle to accumulate
   before treating it as a defect. A single forbidden edge is already
   the violation; catching it at introduction is strictly cheaper than
   untangling a cycle after several more edges have layered on top of
   it.

8. When two or more local checks (lint, format, type, style) overlap in
   the violations they catch, consolidate onto the one tool that covers
   the union rather than running all of them in the same pipeline stage
   — overlapping tools multiply config-drift risk (each needs its own
   ignore-list kept in sync) without adding coverage, and a slower
   combined pipeline gets skipped locally more often than a fast one
   does.

   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis

9. When a local pre-merge check step exists, order its individual checks
   cheapest-and-narrowest first (touched-files-only syntax/format
   checks) and most-expensive-and-broadest last (full-repo type/build
   checks) — a check ordered to fail fast on common, cheap-to-detect
   defects before spending time on expensive ones keeps the step fast
   enough that people keep running it locally instead of skipping to CI.

## Counter-example tests

- Rule 1 counter-example: a central `EventBus` class legitimately touches
  many event-type classes because dispatching *is* its one job — high
  CBO here is not a coupling defect because the class's single
  responsibility is to be the coupling point; the trigger is CBO
  combined with the class ALSO having low cohesion (rule 3), not CBO
  alone.
- Rule 5 counter-example: a `PaymentProcessor` interface with one
  production implementation but a test-only fake substituted in the
  unit-test suite is NOT a removal candidate — "no test double
  substitutes a second implementation" is part of rule 5's condition,
  and a test fake is exactly that second implementation.
