# Five-forces verdict rules (Porter)

Decision rules for rating each of Porter's five forces strong/moderate/
weak and turning that rating into an attractiveness verdict (this
rulebook's `produces.five-forces summary` field). Research trail: layer
2 (Porter's framework, verified at source + DOJ/FTC merger-guideline
thresholds) plus layer 1 (practitioner scoring practice) plus layer 3
(overconfidence-in-forecasting literature bearing on how a verdict
should be hedged).

## Trigger

Apply this skill when rating competitive rivalry, buyer power, supplier
power, threat of new entrants, or threat of substitutes for a segment,
or when combining those five ratings into an overall attractiveness
verdict.

## Procedure

1. When rating rivalry, compute or source an HHI against the current
   DOJ/FTC thresholds rather than eyeballing competitor count, and
   treat low switching costs plus undifferentiated products as another
   signal of strong rivalry (rules 1, 3).
2. When rating buyer or supplier power, check for concentration
   asymmetry (few large buyers/suppliers vs. many sellers, or an
   irreplaceable input) rather than stated negotiating posture (rules
   2, 6).
3. When rating threat of new entrants, check capital requirements to
   reach minimum efficient scale and any regulatory licensing gate
   (rule 4).
4. When rating threat of substitutes, check whether a substitute
   satisfies the same underlying job at lower total cost of ownership,
   even if its category looks unrelated (rule 5).
5. Before publishing any force's rating, pair it with at least one
   quantified data point, and drop any rating that rests only on a
   self-interested competitor statement (rules 7-8).
6. When a force's rating is supported by only one independent data
   source, state the verdict as provisional/low-confidence rather than
   with full certainty (rule 9).
7. When combining the five ratings into a verdict, report them
   separately with the strongest (worst) force named as the binding
   constraint rather than averaging into one bland rating (rule 10).

## Output shape

Each of the five forces rated with a quantified, cited data point,
hedged to its evidence base, and an overall verdict that names the
binding constraint force rather than an averaged score.

## Rules

1. When rating competitive rivalry, do not eyeball "many competitors" —
   compute or source an HHI (sum of squared market-share percentages)
   for the segment; classify HHI < 1,000 as low rivalry pressure,
   1,000-1,800 as moderate, and > 1,800 as high, per the current
   DOJ/FTC Horizontal Merger Guidelines thresholds (lowered from 2,500
   to 1,800 in the 2023 revision). source:

2. When buyer concentration is high relative to seller concentration
   (few large buyers, many sellers), choose "buyer power: strong" —
   concentrated buyers can credibly threaten to switch or backward-
   integrate, which is the structural condition that gives them price
   leverage, not just their stated negotiating posture. source:

3. When switching costs for customers are low and products across
   sellers are largely undifferentiated, choose "rivalry: strong" —
   low differentiation removes the main lever (brand/lock-in) firms
   use to avoid price competition, so rivalry defaults to price-based
   and intense. source:
   https://umbrex.com/resources/frameworks/strategy-frameworks/porters-five-forces/
4. When capital requirements to reach minimum efficient scale are low
   and no regulatory licensing gate exists, choose "threat of new
   entrants: strong" — both are structural entry barriers named by the
   framework; absent either, entry is a live threat regardless of
   current incumbents' comfort. source:

5. When a substitute product satisfies the same underlying job at a
   meaningfully lower total cost of ownership (not just sticker price),
   rate "threat of substitutes: strong" even if the substitute's
   category looks unrelated on the surface — force ratings track job
   fulfillment, not category adjacency. source:
   https://umbrex.com/resources/frameworks/strategy-frameworks/porters-five-forces/
6. When suppliers are few and the input they provide has no ready
   substitute for this product, rate "supplier power: strong" — supplier
   concentration mirrors the buyer-power logic in rule 2 (few sellers of
   an irreplaceable input can dictate terms). source:
   https://umbrex.com/resources/frameworks/strategy-frameworks/porters-five-forces/
7. When every qualitative rating in the five-forces write-up lacks a
   supporting metric (retention rate, concentration ratio, capex
   estimate, switching-cost estimate), do not publish the verdict as-is
   — pair each qualitative label with at least one quantified data point
   before it counts as a rated force, because unpaired qualitative labels
   are exactly the pattern practitioner guidance flags as insufficient
   rigor. source: https://www.workboard.com/resources/blog/porters-5-forces
8. **REMOVAL**: when a force's rating rests only on a single competitor's
   public statement or press release (a self-interested secondary
   source), drop that citation from the evidence base entirely rather
   than keep it as a lesser-weighted data point — self-reported
   competitor claims are not primary evidence for a structural force
   rating, and keeping them papers over a real evidence gap.

9. When the analyst's own confidence in a force's rating is not
   supported by more than one independent data source, state the
   verdict as provisional/low-confidence rather than presenting it with
   the same certainty as a multi-sourced force — managerial and analyst
   forecasts are systematically overconfident when self-assessed without
   an external check, so an unhedged single-source verdict overstates
   what the evidence supports. source:

10. When two forces point in opposite directions (e.g. weak new-entrant
    threat but strong buyer power), do not average them into one bland
    "moderate industry attractiveness" — report the five forces
    separately with the strongest force named as the binding constraint,
    since profitability is capped by whichever single force is worst,
    not by the mean of all five. source:
