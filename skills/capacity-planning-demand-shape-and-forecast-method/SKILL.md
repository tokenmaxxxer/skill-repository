# Demand shape classification and forecast-method selection

Research trail: Google SRE literature on organic/inorganic demand (USENIX ;login: Winter 2020, "SRE Best Practices for Capacity Management", Torres et al.), Holt-Winters vs. ARIMA comparative forecasting studies (ScienceDirect 2024 supply-chain comparison; food-retail Holt-Winters/ARIMA comparison), and general demand-forecasting method literature. All fetched/searched this session.

## Rules

1. When a resource's usage trend is a slow, roughly monotonic increase tied to natural product adoption (more users, more accounts, more stored data) with no single attributable event driving it, classify it as organic demand and fit a linear or exponential regression trend line to the historical series rather than a seasonal or event model — organic growth has no periodic or step-function component for a seasonal/scenario model to capture. source: https://sre.google/static/pdf/login_winter20_10_torres.pdf

2. When a usage increase is traceable to a specific planned business action (a marketing campaign, a feature launch, an acquisition, a partner integration going live), classify it as inorganic demand and model it as a scenario/step-function forecast keyed to the event's launch date and expected magnitude, not as an extrapolation of the pre-event trend line — extrapolating pre-event history under-forecasts because the event itself, not organic growth, is the demand driver. source: https://sre.google/static/pdf/login_winter20_10_torres.pdf

3. When the demand series shows a repeating pattern locked to calendar structure (daily/weekly cycles, holiday peaks, a recurring sales campaign), fit Holt-Winters exponential smoothing (or SARIMA/ARIMA with a seasonal term) rather than a bare linear trend — a comparative study found Holt-Winters captured the linear/seasonal behavior of the series better on inventory-optimization data, while plain trend fits ignore the periodic component entirely and systematically mis-time the peak. source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S294986352400027X

4. When the forecast horizon is short relative to the series' history (near-term, few-period-ahead forecasting) and the series is not strongly trending, prefer ARIMA over Holt-Winters — ARIMA is suitable for short-term forecasting because it prioritizes closer time-series data, while multi-season smoothing models need a longer history to estimate seasonal components reliably. source: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286314562_Demand_forecasting_in_food_retail_A_comparison_between_the_Holt-Winters_and_ARIMA_models

5. When ARIMA/SARIMA is the chosen method but the underlying series has a real trend component (not just seasonality plus noise), do not trust the raw ARIMA/SARIMA fit unchecked — published comparisons note ARIMA/SARIMA models "usually do not take into account trend fluctuations in the data," so pair the fit with an explicit trend term (SARIMAX with a trend regressor, or a hybrid Holt-Winters/ARIMA) rather than assuming seasonality alone explains the residual growth. source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S294986352400027X

6. When building any demand forecast for a capacity decision, always extend the forecast horizon beyond the lead time required to acquire the capacity (hardware order time, quota approval time, provisioning time) — a forecast that only covers what's already knowable inside the lead-time window arrives too late to act on, which is the specific failure mode Google's capacity-management practice calls out as a required property of "an accurate organic demand forecast." source: https://sre.google/static/pdf/login_winter20_10_torres.pdf

7. When a resource is driven by both organic growth and one or more known inorganic events inside the same forecast horizon, forecast the two components separately (trend-fit the organic base, scenario-model each inorganic event) and sum them, rather than fitting one combined model to the blended history — a single model averages the event's step change into the trend slope, which both understates future organic growth in campaign-heavy periods and mis-shapes the event's own step. source: https://sre.google/static/pdf/login_winter20_10_torres.pdf

8. **REMOVAL**: When a prior forecast exists for the same subject/resource and a new forecast is being produced, do not silently overwrite the old number — drop the practice of replacing forecast values with no forecast-vs-actual comparison recorded, and instead diff the new forecast against what actually happened since the last one; a persistent divergence is a model-instability signal (wrong method, mis-classified demand shape, or a missed inorganic event) that must be flagged, not buried under the newer number. source: https://sre.google/static/pdf/login_winter20_10_torres.pdf

9. **REMOVAL**: When a demand series is genuinely organic (steady, no calendar periodicity, no scheduled events), drop Holt-Winters/ARIMA seasonal machinery from the forecast entirely rather than defaulting to it out of habit — fitting seasonal terms to a non-seasonal series adds parameters that fit noise, and a plain regression trend is both simpler and, per the comparative literature, not dominated by the seasonal models outside their actual seasonal use case. source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S294986352400027X

10. When a chosen method fits more than one component into the demand series (a trend plus a seasonal/holiday/campaign term), report the fitted components separately — trend growth rate, seasonal amplitude, and any event/holiday term each stated on their own — rather than a single blended growth number; an additive decomposition lets the forecast-vs-actual comparison (rule 8) attribute a divergence to the specific component that moved (trend accelerated vs. a seasonal peak mis-timed) instead of forcing a re-fit of the whole model to locate it.
