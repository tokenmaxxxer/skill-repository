# Typography pairing rules

## Trigger

Apply this skill when selecting a second typeface to pair with an
already-chosen primary brand typeface, when locking a final font pair
for the brand system, or when an audit of shipped material finds more
typefaces in active use than the guide's stated type system lists.

## Procedure

1. When selecting a second typeface, default to a structurally
   distinct pair over two faces from the same structural family
   (rule 1).
2. Once two structurally distinct faces are shortlisted, pick a final
   pair whose stroke-contrast/weight registers are compatible rather
   than pulling toward opposite ends of the spectrum (rule 2).
3. When an audit finds more typefaces in active use than the guide's
   stated system, remove the excess typefaces and fold any material
   need they served into the two-to-three-face core system (rule 3).

## Output shape

A shortlist of structurally distinct pairing candidates, a locked
final pair with its contrast/weight compatibility noted, and an audit
result listing typefaces to remove to restore the guide's stated
two-to-three-face ceiling.

## Decision rules

### 1. Pair for contrast, not similarity — serif+sans over near-identical sans+sans
- **Condition**: when selecting a second typeface to pair with an already-chosen primary brand typeface for a two-tier hierarchy (headline/body, display/UI)
- **Choice**: default to a structurally distinct pair (serif + sans-serif, or a high-contrast display face + a neutral low-contrast workhorse face) over two faces from the same structural family that merely differ in weight
- **Why**: the structural difference (feet vs. no feet, stroke-contrast level) does the hierarchy work automatically — two same-family faces at similar weight force the layout itself to carry all the hierarchy signal and read as "almost matching" rather than deliberately paired
- **Source**: 99designs, "3 principles you need to pair typefaces perfectly", https://99designs.com/blog/tips/typeface-pairing-principles/ ; The Crit, "Font Pairing Guide: Rules, Tools, and Combinations That Work", https://thecrit.co/resources/font-pairing-guide
- **Counter-example test**: pairing Helvetica Regular headlines with Arial Regular body copy fails this rule — both are low-contrast grotesque sans faces with near-identical proportions, so the pairing reads as an inconsistency (wrong font substituted) rather than an intentional two-tier system.

### 2. Match contrast level between the two chosen faces; don't pair a fragile high-contrast serif with a heavy low-contrast display sans
- **Condition**: once two structurally distinct faces are shortlisted (rule 1 satisfied) and a final pair must be locked for the brand system
- **Choice**: pick a second face whose own stroke-contrast/weight character sits in a compatible register with the first — a high-contrast display serif (e.g. Playfair/Fraunces-class) pairs with a clean, fairly neutral sans (e.g. Inter/Source-Sans-class), while a low-contrast slab serif pairs with a humanist sans of similar visual weight
- **Why**: two faces that are individually striking but pull toward opposite ends of the contrast/weight spectrum compete for dominance on the page instead of forming a hierarchy — "one loud, one quiet" is the rule of thumb every source converges on for why some serif/sans pairs feel wrong despite passing the structural-contrast rule

- **Counter-example test**: pairing a fragile high-contrast display serif (thin hairlines) as body-text-sized copy against a heavy black-weight grotesque sans headline fails this rule at any size — both faces demand visual dominance and the hairline serif becomes illegible at small sizes on top of the clash.

### 3. Cap the brand system at two-to-three typefaces total; retire an unused third/fourth face rather than let it accumulate from campaign-specific additions
- **Condition**: when an audit of shipped brand material turns up more distinct typefaces in active use than the guide's own stated type system lists
- **Choice**: remove typefaces from the active brand type system that exist only because a past campaign or a single team introduced them, folding any material need they served into the two-to-three-face core system instead of formally adding a fourth/fifth face to "cover" it
- **Why**: readability and brand coherence both degrade past two-to-three typefaces per system — every source on font pairing converges on a 2-3 face ceiling — but the failure mode in practice is not overshooting on day one, it's each new campaign silently adding "just one more" face and nobody removing the earlier one-off later

- **Counter-example test**: a brand guide that states "2 typefaces" in its type-system page while an asset audit finds 5 distinct typefaces across the last year's shipped materials fails this rule — the guide's additive drift was never pruned back to its own stated ceiling.
