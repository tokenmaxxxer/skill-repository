# Expansion-trigger threshold sizing (growth_rate x lead_time x safety_buffer)

Research trail: Little's Law (L = λW; Little 1961), Dan Slimmon's applied Little's-Law capacity-scaling writeup (worker-thread occupancy example), production-system utilization-threshold findings (Project Production Institute), and percentile-occupancy planning practice. All fetched/searched this session.

## Trigger

Apply this skill when sizing the threshold at which an expansion
should fire: computing required occupancy, decomposing the threshold
into growth_rate x lead_time x safety_buffer, picking a target
percentile, or accounting for provisioning lead time and ramp-up.

## Procedure

1. Compute required occupancy via Little's Law (L = λW) before sizing
   the expansion (rule 1).
2. State the threshold as growth_rate x lead_time x safety_buffer with
   each term labeled and traceable, not a bare flat percentage
   (rule 2).
3. Size the threshold off a stated percentile of the occupancy
   distribution, never the mean alone (rule 3).
4. Treat roughly 80-85% utilization as the practical trigger zone under
   queueing dynamics (rule 4).
5. Size lead_time as the full span from trigger firing to new capacity
   actually serving traffic, including provisioning and warm-up
   (rule 5), and extend it further to cover a ramp-up window in which
   throughput climbs to 100% rather than treating the endpoint as
   instantly fully productive (rule 12).
6. Use the combined organic-plus-inorganic forecast as the growth_rate
   input (rule 6).
7. Size safety_buffer from demand variability, lead-time variability,
   and the required service level (rule 7), choosing the target
   percentile by the resource's failure consequence rather than a
   house-wide default (rule 8).
8. Never carry forward an inherited bare-percentage threshold with no
   growth_rate/lead_time/safety_buffer decomposition; recompute all
   three terms explicitly (rule 9), and never stop at the mean/average
   without taking the percentile step (rule 10).
9. For a resource with genuine elastic on-demand provisioning, size
   safety_buffer to the residual lead_time-window risk only, not a
   static buffer computed as if all future growth had to be
   pre-provisioned (rule 11).

## Output shape

A threshold stated as growth_rate x lead_time x safety_buffer with
each term labeled and traceable to its source, sized off a stated
percentile matched to the resource's failure consequence, with
lead_time covering the full trigger-to-serving span including ramp-up.

## Rules

1. When sizing how many additional units of a resource (servers, worker threads, connections, shards) an expansion needs to add, compute required occupancy as arrival_rate x average_wait_time per Little's Law (L = λW) first, then size the expansion against that computed occupancy — not against a flat headcount guess — because L = λW gives the exact long-run average in-flight count the resource must sustain. source: https://blog.danslimmon.com/2022/06/07/using-littles-law-to-scale-applications/

2. When the expansion-trigger threshold is being stated, express it as growth_rate x lead_time x safety_buffer with each term labeled and traceable to a source number, not as a bare flat percentage (e.g. "expand at 80%") — a bare percentage hides which of the three terms is driving the trigger and cannot be re-derived when any one input changes. source: https://blog.danslimmon.com/2022/06/07/using-littles-law-to-scale-applications/

3. When computing L = λW for a trigger threshold, never use the mean/average λ and W alone to size the buffer — Little's Law gives only the long-term average, and the same source that derives it explicitly warns "from moment to moment, the occupancy of the system will vary around this average," so the threshold must be sized off a stated percentile (e.g. p95/p97.5/p99) of the occupancy distribution, not the mean. source: https://blog.danslimmon.com/2022/06/07/using-littles-law-to-scale-applications/

4. When a system's utilization approaches roughly 80-85% under queueing dynamics, treat that band as the practical trigger zone for expansion rather than waiting for visible saturation — production-system analysis using Little's Law found cycle-time explosion (queue buildup) becomes very likely once utilization crosses that band, because a system with no spare capacity margin turns any minor delay into a compounding queue. source: https://projectproduction.org/journal/littles-law-a-practical-approach-to-understanding-production-system-performance/

5. When sizing the lead_time term of the threshold formula, use the full time from "trigger fires" to "new capacity is actually serving traffic" (procurement/provisioning/warm-up, not just the order-placement step) — a threshold that only accounts for order lead time and ignores provisioning/warm-up time fires too late, because unserved demand accrues for the entire gap, not just the ordering portion of it. source: https://sre.google/static/pdf/login_winter20_10_torres.pdf

6. When the growth_rate term is derived from a forecast that mixes organic and inorganic demand, use the combined (summed) forecast from the demand-shape axis's rule 7 as the growth_rate input, not the organic component alone — a threshold sized only off organic growth under-triggers whenever a scheduled inorganic event lands inside the lead-time window, since the event's step change is real unserved demand the trigger must account for.

7. When the safety_buffer term is being chosen, size it from the same variability-and-service-level logic used for physical-inventory safety stock — buffer scales with demand variability, lead-time variability, and the required service level, and going from a 90% to a 99% service level can "nearly double" the needed buffer rather than scaling linearly — so treat safety_buffer as a function of the target percentile, not a flat constant reused across all resources. source: https://www.workingcapitalhub.com/inventory/safety-stock-explained/

8. When stating the threshold's target percentile, pick it based on the resource's failure consequence, not a single house-wide default — a resource whose exhaustion silently degrades (e.g. background batch capacity) can be sized to a lower percentile (e.g. p90) than one whose exhaustion is user-visible and hard to reverse quickly (e.g. request-serving capacity), which should be sized to a higher percentile (p97.5-p99) per the same service-level-drives-buffer-size logic. source: https://www.workingcapitalhub.com/inventory/safety-stock-explained/

9. **REMOVAL**: When a prior threshold was set as a bare percentage with no recorded growth_rate/lead_time/safety_buffer decomposition, do not carry that bare number forward unchanged into a new capacity record — drop the undecomposed figure and recompute all three terms explicitly, because an unlabeled inherited number cannot be checked for staleness (a lead time that has since shortened, or a growth rate that has since changed) and silently perpetuates whatever assumptions produced it originally. source: https://blog.danslimmon.com/2022/06/07/using-littles-law-to-scale-applications/

10. **REMOVAL**: When the average-latency/average-occupancy figures alone are already in hand and look adequate for a trigger decision, do not stop there and skip the percentile step — drop the practice of using the mean as a stand-in for tail behavior; the source deriving L = λW itself flags this as insufficient because moment-to-moment variance around the mean is exactly what a trigger threshold must be safe against, not the average case. source: https://blog.danslimmon.com/2022/06/07/using-littles-law-to-scale-applications/

11. When the resource has genuine elastic on-demand provisioning (new units can be added and serving traffic within the stated lead_time, not merely ordered within it), size safety_buffer to cover only the residual risk during that lead_time window — forecast error plus provisioning-time demand growth — rather than a large static buffer computed as if every unit of future growth had to be pre-provisioned ahead of time; conflating the two inflates safety_buffer far past what the actual gap-to-cover requires and hides how much of the term is lead-time risk versus pure margin.

12. When the lead_time term's endpoint is reached (new units are provisioned and nominally serving), do not treat that unit as delivering its full rated capacity from that instant — model a ramp-up window in which the new unit's effective throughput climbs from a stated starting fraction to 100% (e.g. a new instance still warming caches, a new human-staffed capacity pool still onboarding), and extend the lead_time term to cover that ramp, not just the provisioning step; a threshold that assumes instant-100% availability at lead_time's end under-covers exactly the ramp window, the same "treat-ramp-as-instant" anti-pattern flagged for headcount capacity applies identically to warm-up-limited infrastructure capacity.
    tool: `capacity-planner` skill, `alirezarezvani/claude-skills` (Claude Code skills marketplace repo; 24,392 GitHub stars — adoption evidence: `gh api repos/alirezarezvani/claude-skills --jq .stargazers_count` executed this session).
    problem: a capacity plan that counts newly-provisioned units as 100%-productive the instant lead_time elapses silently under-covers the ramp-up window, producing a real capacity gap the threshold formula never accounted for.
    how: the skill's `capacity_anti_patterns.md` reference names this "Treat-Ramp-as-Instant" and requires a productivity factor that ramps from a partial starting value to 100% over a stated `ramp_time_weeks`, front-loading hiring/provisioning against the adjusted (not nominal) target.
    learning -> upgrades this axis's rule 5 (lead_time = provisioning + warm-up, not just ordering): the ramp window itself must be modeled as a graded throughput curve inside lead_time, not collapsed into a single "done at T" step function.
