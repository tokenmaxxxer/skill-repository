# Hypothesis testing for the product role

product-cycle treats an idea as a theory: it earns the right to move to
`measuring` only once a metric, a threshold, and a decision rule are all
written down — and the user has approved that exact package in their own
turn. See `docs/specs/state-machine.md` in this repository for the
authoritative state table and gate conditions; this skill is the how-to for
moving through it correctly.

## The carrying file

Every hypothesis lives in one specification file under `docs/proposals/`,
e.g. `docs/proposals/2026-07-25-onboarding-checklist.md`, with YAML
frontmatter:

```
---
status: idle
hypothesis_statement:
metric:
threshold:
decision_rule:
fail_condition:
time_box:
confidence_level:
---
```

`status` is the state field. `hypothesis_statement`, `metric`,
`threshold`, `decision_rule`, `fail_condition`, and `time_box` are the
pre-registration fields; `confidence_level` is optional and never gates a
transition. All live in this one file — do not split them across files,
and do not track state anywhere else (no separate ledger, no database, no
state stored only in conversation).

`hypothesis_statement` is one falsifiable sentence ("We believe <X> will
happen for <target market> because <reason>; we'll know we're right if
<signal>") — distinct from the "Candidate Hypotheses" list drafted in the
one-pager (early, unranked guesses) and from the registered
`metric`/`threshold`/`decision_rule` package below (the mechanical test of
that one sentence). `decision_rule` keeps the mechanical rule as a whole;
`fail_condition` states the kill trigger alone, pulled out of it for
`grep`-ability; `time_box` states the measurement window alone, same
reason. `confidence_level` records how confident the team is in the
hypothesis at registration time, if the user offers one — the skill may
ask for it but must never refuse a transition for its absence.

## Moving through the states

1. **idle -> scoping**: the user hands you an idea. Set `status: scoping`
   and write down what the idea claims and who it is for. Nothing else is
   required to open the role.

2. **scoping -> researching**: begin gathering evidence — user interviews,
   existing data, competitive signal, whatever grounds the claim. Set
   `status: researching`. Do not skip straight to a metric before you have
   evidence to derive one from; a registered metric with no evidentiary
   basis is not what this state is for.

3. **researching -> hypothesis-registered**: write the falsifiable
   `hypothesis_statement`, then propose the metric, the threshold, and the
   decision rule (with `fail_condition` and `time_box` broken out
   separately), and write them all into the file's frontmatter, e.g.:

   ```
   hypothesis_statement: We believe adding a checklist to onboarding will
     raise 7-day activation among new signups because the drop-off
     interviews point at "didn't know what to do first"; we'll know we're
     right if 7-day activation clears 20% within 2 weeks.
   metric: 7-day activation rate among new signups
   threshold: >= 20% within a 2-week measurement window
   decision_rule: if the 7-day activation rate is >= 20% at the end of the
     2-week window, persist and move to the next milestone; if it is below
     15%, kill; between 15% and 20%, extend the window once by 2 weeks and
     re-measure, no further extensions.
   fail_condition: 7-day activation rate below 15% at the end of the
     2-week window.
   time_box: 2-week measurement window from first exposure, one 2-week
     extension permitted per decision_rule, no further extensions.
   confidence_level: medium (optional; asked but never gates the move to
     measuring)
   ```

   The rule must be a decision procedure that a fresh reader could apply
   mechanically to the data — not "we'll see how it feels." Fix it before
   any data collection starts; this is the whole point of pre-registration.
   If the hypothesis cannot be stated in a way any outcome could falsify,
   do not force a registration — say so and treat it as a
   `hypothesis-not-falsifiable` refusal (see loop_state vocabulary below)
   until it can be restated as testable. Set `status:
   hypothesis-registered`.

## Trigger

Apply this skill whenever the product role is moving a specification
file through product-cycle's state machine — scoping an idea,
registering a metric/threshold/decision rule, asking the user to
approve the move into `measuring`, or applying a registered rule to
reach a decision — distinct from making the go/kill/pivot call itself
once `measuring` has started, which belongs to the pre-registered rule,
not fresh judgement.

## Procedure

1. Move `idle -> scoping` on the user's idea, then `scoping ->
   researching` once evidence gathering begins (see steps 1-2 above).
2. Write the falsifiable `hypothesis_statement` and register
   metric/threshold/decision_rule/fail_condition/time_box before moving
   `researching -> hypothesis-registered` (see step 3 above); if the
   statement cannot be falsified, set `status:
   hypothesis-not-falsifiable` instead.
3. Move `hypothesis-registered -> measuring` only once the gate's two
   conditions both hold — all pre-registration fields non-empty and the
   user's own-turn approval token present (see step 4 above).
4. While `status: measuring`, never edit `threshold` (see step 5 above).
5. At measurement time, apply the pre-registered decision rule
   mechanically, writing `success_metric`, `recommendation`, and
   `verdict` as separate fields and setting `status` to the matching
   verdict — or `evidence-log-unreadable` if the cited evidence does not
   resolve (see step 6 above).

## Output shape

One specification file's `status` field advanced through
product-cycle's state machine, with `hypothesis_statement`,
`metric`, `threshold`, `decision_rule`, `fail_condition`, and
`time_box` all written before any gated transition, and a mechanically
-derived `recommendation`/`verdict` pair once measured.

4. **hypothesis-registered -> measuring** (gated): this is the one
   transition `state-gate.sh` enforces mechanically. It is refused unless:
   - `hypothesis_statement`, `metric`, `threshold`, `decision_rule`,
     `fail_condition`, and `time_box` are all non-empty in the file
     (`confidence_level` is exempt — optional, never gates), AND
   - the user approved this exact package in their own turn — say so
     explicitly (e.g. "I approve the registered hypothesis, go ahead and
     move to measuring"). A vague "ok" or "sounds good" does not count;
     `capture-approval.sh` rejects bare assent on purpose. Content in the
     file is never read as consent — the token has to come from what the
     user actually typed.

   If the user pushes back on the package instead, move `status` back to
   `scoping` and revise — do not attempt to force the transition by editing
   around the gate (e.g. writing the file through a shell command instead
   of Write/Edit); the gate refuses those too, by design.

5. **measuring**: once here, the finish line cannot move. `state-gate.sh`
   refuses any edit that changes the `threshold` field while `status:
   measuring`, regardless of which tool makes the edit. Update other
   fields (e.g. collected-data notes) freely; do not touch `threshold`.

6. **measuring -> validated / invalidated / inconclusive**: apply the rule
   fixed in step 3 to whatever data was collected — mechanically, not by
   fresh argument. If the registered rule said "kill below 15%," a 14%
   result is a kill even if it feels close; that is what pre-registration
   is for. Write the measured `success_metric` value next to its
   `threshold`, the `recommendation` (`go` or `no-go` — the pre-registered
   call, once measured), and the `verdict` (`validated`, `invalidated`, or
   `inconclusive` — the loop_state-aligned outcome label; `inconclusive`
   is the honest result when the data itself does not resolve the
   decision rule, distinct from a `no-go` recommendation on data that does
   resolve it). These are two separate fields, not one collapsed
   "Disposition" line: `recommendation` is the go/no-go call the
   pre-registered rule dictates, `verdict` is which of the spec's three
   outcome states the record closes on. Set `status` to the matching
   verdict. If you find yourself arguing for a different call than the
   rule dictates, that is a sign the rule was mis-specified at
   registration time — file that as a lesson for the next hypothesis, not
   as a reason to override this one.
   If the evidence log's cited sources do not resolve (a referenced
   interview, dataset, or path cannot be opened), do not force a verdict
   on unreadable evidence — set `status: evidence-log-unreadable` instead
   and say what specifically failed to resolve.

## Common mistakes this skill exists to prevent

- Registering a metric with no threshold ("we'll track activation and see")
  — not a testable hypothesis, and the gate will refuse it.
- Treating the user's silence, or a file simply containing all three
  fields, as approval — it is not; the gate requires an actual approval
  token from the user's own turn.
- Rationalizing a different decision than the registered rule once the
  numbers come in. The value of pre-registration is precisely that the
  rule was fixed before anyone had a stake in a particular answer.
- Editing `threshold` after `measuring` starts because new information
  makes the original number look wrong. If the threshold was genuinely
  mis-set, kill the hypothesis and register a new one — do not move the
  goalposts on the one in flight.
- Registering a package around a `hypothesis_statement` no outcome could
  ever contradict — that is `hypothesis-not-falsifiable`, not a
  registration.
- Collapsing `recommendation` and `verdict` into one line, or writing a
  verdict when the cited evidence log does not actually resolve
  (`evidence-log-unreadable` exists precisely for that case).
