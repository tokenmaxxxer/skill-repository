# Safety-buffer sizing by criticality and blast radius

Research trail: safety-stock/service-level supply-chain literature (Working Capital Hub's safety-stock formula guide, SPS Commerce's formula-selection guide, Verusen/Verdantis on criticality-weighted spare-parts buffers), applied to capacity buffers rather than physical inventory. All fetched/searched this session.

## Trigger

Apply this skill when sizing a resource's safety_buffer by its
criticality and blast radius: choosing a service-level target, ranking
criticality against demand history, sizing a buffer for a shared or
sparse-history resource, or revisiting a buffer after a driver
changes.

## Procedure

1. Derive the buffer from demand variability, lead-time variability,
   and required service level rather than a single house-wide
   percentage (rule 1).
2. Size a hard-outage/user-visible-unavailability resource's buffer to
   a high service level such as p99 (rule 2), and a
   graceful-degradation resource's buffer to a lower service level
   such as p90 deliberately (rule 3).
3. Rank buffer sizing by operational consequence first and demand
   history second when two resources share a growth rate but differ in
   criticality (rule 4).
4. When lead time itself is volatile, increase the buffer specifically
   for lead-time variance, separate from demand-variance buffer
   (rule 5).
5. When a single resource serves mixed-criticality workloads, size the
   buffer to the highest-criticality consumer, not an average across
   consumers (rule 6).
6. State which driver (demand variability, lead-time variability, or
   service-level target) is actually pushing the buffer number
   (rule 7).
7. For sparse-history or new resources, do not default to a low buffer
   just because computed variance looks small (rule 8).
8. Retire a flat-percentage buffer copied across resources of differing
   criticality (rule 9), and lower a buffer whose blast radius has
   since shrunk rather than leaving the original high-criticality
   buffer in place (rule 10).
9. When enough recent usage history exists, derive the buffer from a
   rolling recent-usage window rather than a flat org-wide default
   (rule 11).

## Output shape

A safety_buffer sized from demand variability, lead-time variability,
and a service-level target chosen by failure consequence rather than a
flat percentage, attributed to its driving factor, sized to the
highest-criticality consumer when shared, and revisited as blast
radius or usage history changes.

## Rules

1. When choosing a safety_buffer size for a resource, derive it from the same three drivers physical safety-stock formulas use — demand variability, lead-time variability, and required service level — rather than picking a single house-wide buffer percentage for every resource, because a resource with volatile demand or a long, uncertain provisioning lead time needs materially more buffer than a stable, fast-to-provision one even at the same service-level target. source: https://www.workingcapitalhub.com/inventory/safety-stock-explained/

2. When a resource's failure mode is a hard outage or user-visible unavailability if capacity runs out (request-serving fleets, primary databases), size its buffer to a high service level (e.g. p99) — moving from a 90% to a 99% service level can "nearly double" the required buffer rather than scaling linearly, so a high-blast-radius resource's buffer is not a small increment over a low-blast-radius resource's, it is disproportionately larger. source: https://www.workingcapitalhub.com/inventory/safety-stock-explained/

3. When a resource's failure mode is graceful degradation (background jobs queue longer, batch processing delays, non-critical caches miss more) rather than a hard outage, size its buffer to a lower service level (e.g. p90) deliberately — over-buffering a resource whose exhaustion is tolerable spends the same disproportionate buffer cost the p99 case incurs for a case that doesn't need it, which is real waste under the same nonlinear service-level-to-buffer relationship. source: https://www.workingcapitalhub.com/inventory/safety-stock-explained/

4. When two resources have the same forecasted growth rate but different criticality, rank buffer sizing by operational consequence first and demand history second — criticality-weighted buffer methodology explicitly assigns buffer "by operational consequence first, demand history second," which is the specific failure mode plain formula-driven buffers (that weight only historical demand variance) miss when a low-history, high-consequence resource looks deceptively safe on paper. source: https://verusen.com/spare-parts-management/how-to-calculate-mro-safety-stock/

5. When a resource's provisioning lead time itself is volatile (vendor lead times vary, quota approval timing is unpredictable, cross-team dependencies add unknown delay), increase the safety_buffer term specifically for lead-time variance, separate from and in addition to demand-variance buffer — the standard safety-stock drivers treat lead-time variability as its own independent driver of buffer size, not something covered by a demand-variance margin alone. source: https://www.spscommerce.com/community/articles/how-to-calculate-safety-stock-formulas-and-methods-that-fit-your-data

6. When a single resource serves workloads of mixed criticality (e.g. one shared cluster serves both a customer-facing API and an internal batch job), size the buffer to the highest-criticality consumer on that resource, not an average across consumers — a blast-radius framing means the worst-case failure mode determines the required protection, and averaging criticality across consumers under-buffers the resource for its most consequential use.

7. When justifying a buffer size in a capacity record, state which formula driver (demand variability, lead-time variability, or service-level target) is actually pushing the number, rather than presenting a single combined buffer percentage with no attribution — an unattributed buffer number cannot be revisited correctly when only one driver changes (e.g. lead time shortens after a new vendor contract), forcing a full re-derivation instead of a targeted update.

8. When historical demand data for a resource is sparse or the resource is new (no mature demand history to compute variance from), do not default to a low buffer just because computed variance looks small — sparse-history buffer methodology explicitly separates "criticality-weighted" sizing from pure demand-history-driven sizing for exactly this case, because low observed variance from too little data is not the same as low true variance. source: https://verusen.com/spare-parts-management/how-to-calculate-mro-safety-stock/

9. **REMOVAL**: When a resource's buffer has historically been set as one flat percentage applied uniformly across all resources regardless of criticality, retire that flat-percentage practice for any resource where criticality or blast radius differs from the peer resources it was copied from — carrying forward a shared flat number silently overprotects the low-consequence resources (wasted cost) while underprotecting the high-consequence ones (real risk), which is the opposite of what a criticality-weighted buffer is supposed to prevent. source: https://verusen.com/spare-parts-management/how-to-calculate-mro-safety-stock/

10. **REMOVAL**: When a resource's blast radius has shrunk (e.g. a formerly single-point-of-failure service now sits behind redundancy or a circuit breaker that contains its failure), lower its safety_buffer target instead of leaving the original high-criticality buffer in place — leaving an outsized buffer after the underlying risk driver is gone is the same "buffer no longer attributable to a real driver" failure as rule 7 warns against, just discovered after the fact rather than at design time.

11. When a resource has enough recent usage history to compute one, derive its safety_buffer from a rolling recent-usage window (its own observed burn-rate/variance over the last N days) rather than a single flat org-wide default reused across resources with different actual consumption patterns — a personalized, recency-weighted buffer tracks a resource's real current variability, while a flat default is only correct for whichever resource happened to match the assumptions it was set from.
    tool: `Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor`, `Maciek-roboblog/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor` (Claude Code usage monitor with predictive burn-rate warnings; 8,625 GitHub stars — adoption evidence: `gh api repos/Maciek-roboblog/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor --jq .stargazers_count` executed this session).
    problem: a fixed plan-wide usage limit produces false-positive warnings for light users and misses real exhaustion risk for heavy users, because it ignores how differently each entity actually consumes the resource.
    how: the "Custom" plan mode analyzes all sessions from the trailing 192 hours (8 days) per user and computes a personalized limit and burn-rate projection from that rolling window, instead of applying one static plan-wide number.
    learning -> upgrades this axis's rule 1 (derive buffer from demand variability/lead-time variability/service level, not a house-wide percentage): the variability driver itself should be computed from each resource's own rolling recent-usage window, not a single point-in-time or org-wide estimate, so the buffer stays current as the resource's actual consumption pattern shifts.
