# Requirement extraction

Decomposing a spec/issue into a discrete, checkable requirement list — phase 1
of a conformance-review pass, before any verdict is rendered.

## Trigger

Apply this skill when decomposing a spec or issue into a discrete,
checkable requirement list — phase 1 of a conformance-review pass,
before any verdict is rendered.

## Procedure

1. Split any requirement sentence bundling more than one obligation with
   "and"/"또한" across independent clauses into one line item per
   obligation (rule 1).
2. Flag a requirement with no observable success condition as
   unverifiable-as-written and request the missing acceptance threshold,
   rather than inventing one (rule 2).
3. Drop a derived/summary line restating three or more sub-points
   already listed elsewhere, keeping only its sub-points (rule 3).
4. When the issue's acceptance section already states a sampling
   derivation, use it verbatim as the requirement list's scope rather
   than re-deriving your own N (rule 4).
5. Keep a requirement whose check-worthiness or expected verdict is
   conditional on another requirement's outcome as its own list item,
   stating the dependency inline (rule 5).
6. Tag each extracted requirement with its dimension type — functional
   behavior, error-handling, edge-case, or scope-boundary (rule 6).

## Output shape

A dimension-tagged, one-obligation-per-line requirement list: bundled
sentences split, redundant summary lines dropped, unverifiable-as-written
items flagged instead of guessed, and conditional or sampling-derived
scope stated explicitly rather than silently re-derived.

## Rules

1. **When** a requirement sentence bundles more than one obligation with "and"/
   "또한" across independent clauses (e.g. "the API validates input and logs
   rejected requests"), **split** it into one line item per obligation before
   listing — a bundled line lets a partial build score as one Present instead
   of surfacing the missing half. source: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 requirement
   characteristic "singular" (one requirement, one testable statement).
   ([SEBoK: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148](https://sebokwiki.org/wiki/ISO/IEC/IEEE_29148))

2. **When** a requirement statement carries no observable success condition
   (a noun phrase or goal with no measurable trigger — "the system should be
   fast", "errors are handled gracefully"), **flag it unverifiable-as-written**
   and request the missing acceptance threshold rather than inventing one —
   do not silently substitute your own numeric bar. source: requirements
   ambiguity/testability literature — checklists catch single-sentence
   ambiguity but require an explicit missing-criterion flag, not a filled-in
   guess. ([Kamsties, Berry & Paech, "Detecting Ambiguities in Requirements
   Documents Using Inspections"](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~dberry/FTP_SITE/reprints.journals.conferences/KamstiesBerryPaech2001DetectingAmbiguity.pdf))

3. **When** a requirement is itself a derived/summary line restating three or
   more sub-points already listed elsewhere in the same spec, **drop the
   summary line from the checkable list** and keep only its sub-points — a
   redundant top-level item double-counts coverage in the completeness ratio
   and inflates N without adding a new check. (removal) source: ISO/IEC/IEEE
   29148 "unambiguous"/"consistent" characteristics — a requirement set with
   duplicated obligations fails the standard's own consistency check.
   ([Well-Architected Guide: ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 SRS template](https://www.well-architected-guide.com/documents/iso-iec-ieee-29148-template/))

4. **When** an issue's acceptance section already states a sampling derivation
   instead of a full enumeration (e.g. "spot-check 5 of 40 files"), **use the
   stated derivation verbatim as the requirement list's scope** rather than
   re-deriving your own N — re-deriving silently changes what "complete" means
   mid-review. source: this repo's own record-format convention (a derived:
   line must cite the actual command/path that produced a count claim).

5. **When** one requirement's check-worthiness or expected verdict is
   conditional on another requirement's outcome (e.g. "requirement B only
   applies if requirement A's flag is enabled"), **keep each as its own list
   item and state the dependency inline**, rather than merging B into A's
   line or silently dropping B when A doesn't obviously apply — a merged or
   dropped conditional requirement disappears from the checkable list instead
   of surfacing as a requirement whose applicability itself needs a verdict.

6. **When** extracting a requirement, **tag it with its dimension type**
   (functional behavior, error-handling, edge-case, or scope-boundary) rather
   than leaving every extracted item in one undifferentiated list — a
   requirement list with no dimension tags cannot show whether error-handling
   or edge-case coverage was actually sampled, only that some N requirements
   were checked overall. source: specification-readiness scoring practice
   that grades a spec across named dimensions (problem statement, scope,
   acceptance criteria, error handling, edge cases) separately rather than as
   one undifferentiated completeness score.
