# Competitor-mapping rules (direct vs indirect)

Decision rules for classifying a competitor as direct or indirect and
attaching evidence to every claimed fact (this rulebook's
`produces.competitor list w/ evidence links` field). Research trail:
layer 1 (practitioner classification criteria) plus layer 3 (evidence
sourcing rigor, shared with evidence-rigor axis).

## Trigger

Apply this skill when classifying a competitor as direct or indirect,
adding or evaluating an entry in a competitor list, tracing a
secondary-sourced competitor fact back to its primary source, planning
monitoring cadence across the list, or checking a comparison table for
redundant or double-counted entries.

## Procedure

1. When classifying, check both product-category overlap and
   evaluation-set overlap before calling a competitor direct (rule 1),
   and check for job overlap without product-category overlap before
   calling one indirect (rule 2).
2. When segmenting by purchasing pattern, determine whether the buyer
   defaults to this category or only sometimes evaluates it before
   assigning direct vs. indirect (rule 3).
3. When adding a competitor entry, require an evidence link for every
   claimed fact, and if the source is secondary, trace the citation
   chain to the primary source before citing it (rules 4-5).
4. When cadence-planning follow-up monitoring, assign direct
   competitors to high-frequency tracking and indirect competitors to
   lower-frequency tracking (rule 6).
5. When a listed competitor fails both the direct and indirect
   evaluation-set tests on evidence check, drop the entry rather than
   downgrade it (rule 7).
6. When building the comparison table, merge structurally identical
   direct competitors into one row, and merge sibling brands of the
   same underlying company into one entity, to keep the table MECE
   (rules 8, 10).
7. When a competitor is privately held with no public filings, state
   its facts as sourced-from-secondhand and label them lower-confidence
   rather than omitting or fabricating precision (rule 9).

## Output shape

A competitor list where each entry is classified direct or indirect by
the product-category-and-evaluation-set / job-overlap tests, carries an
evidence link traced to its primary source, is assigned a monitoring
cadence matching its class, and contains no duplicate or double-counted
rows.

## Rules

1. When a company sells the same product/service category to the same
   target customer and buyers actively compare it before purchase,
   classify it **direct** — direct competitors are defined by both
   product-category overlap and evaluation-set overlap, not either
   alone. source: https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/indirect-competitor-vs-direct
2. When a company sells a different product/service but satisfies the
   same underlying job for the same customer set (Christensen's
   milkshake example: shakes competing with bananas and bagels, not
   other shakes), classify it **indirect** — indirect status is defined
   by job overlap, not product-category overlap. source:

3. When classifying, do not stop at "same industry" — segment by
   purchasing pattern first: buyers who evaluate this spec's category as
   their default choice are direct customers, buyers who default to an
   adjacent category and only sometimes evaluate this one are indirect.

4. When a competitor entry is added to the list, require an evidence
   link (pricing page, SEC/DART filing, product doc, or a dated
   screenshot) attached to every claimed fact about it (price, feature,
   position) — an unlinked claim does not count as an entry, it counts
   as an assumption and must be labeled as one. source:
   https://researcher.life/blog/article/primary-vs-secondary-sources-differences-and-examples/
5. When a fact about a competitor comes from a secondary source (an
   analyst report, a news article) that itself cites a primary source
   (the competitor's own filing or pricing page), trace the chain and
   cite the primary source directly rather than the secondary summary —
   tracing the citation chain is standard practice for rigorous
   evidence use. source:

6. When cadence-planning follow-up monitoring, assign direct
   competitors to high-frequency tactical tracking (pricing, feature
   ships, campaigns) and indirect competitors to lower-frequency
   strategic-trend tracking — the two classes warrant different
   monitoring cost, not the same watch-list treatment. source:
   https://www.competitiveintelligencealliance.io/what-is-indirect-competition-examples/
7. **REMOVAL**: when a listed "competitor" turns out, on evidence check,
   to serve a different customer segment with no purchase-decision
   overlap (rule 1's evaluation-set test fails), drop the entry from the
   competitor list entirely rather than downgrade it to a vague "watch"
   tier — an entry that fails both the direct and indirect tests is
   noise in the list, not a lesser signal. source:
   https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/indirect-competitor-vs-direct
8. When two direct competitors' offerings are structurally identical on
   every dimension the customer evaluates, do not list them as separate
   distinguishing rows in the comparison table — merge them into one row
   noting "functionally equivalent to X" so the table stays MECE
   (each row a distinct evaluated position) rather than padded with
   duplicate positions. source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle
9. When a competitor is privately held and has no public filings or
   pricing page, do not silently omit it from the list because evidence
   is harder to get — state its facts as sourced-from-secondhand
   (customer interviews, review sites, job postings signaling
   headcount/roadmap) explicitly labeled as lower-confidence, rather
   than either fabricating precision or dropping a real competitor.

10. When the same underlying company sells through multiple brands
    targeting the same job (e.g. a parent company's budget and premium
    lines), list them as one competitor entity with sub-brand notes,
    not as separate unrelated rows — treating sibling brands as
    independent competitors double-counts one strategic actor's market
    share. source: https://www.justice.gov/atr/herfindahl-hirschman-index
