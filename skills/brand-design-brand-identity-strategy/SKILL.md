  Use when proposing a new visual direction for a brand asset, auditing whether a shipped
  asset is consistent with the brand's declared identity, or reviewing an identity guide for
  facets the brand no longer actually delivers on. Trigger on requests like "new visual
  direction", "does this fit our brand identity", "identity guide facet review", "브랜드 아이덴티티에
  맞는지 검토해줘". Do NOT use for approval workflow, edit permissions, or asset-library hygiene (use
  brand-design-brand-consistency-governance).

# Brand identity strategy rules

Rules for the `decides: 브랜드 정체성이 시각적으로 일관되는가` half of
this role's contract — checking that a visual choice actually maps
back to the brand's declared identity rather than being style-work in
isolation. Grounded in Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism (this role's
own rulebook plugin is already named `brand-design-kapferer-scope-guard`,
confirming the prism as this repo's chosen framework).

## Trigger

Apply this skill when a new visual direction is proposed for a brand
asset, when auditing whether a shipped asset is consistent with the
brand's identity rather than merely internally attractive, or during a
periodic identity-guide review.

## Procedure

1. When a new visual direction is proposed, require it to trace to a
   stated Physique or Personality facet before shipping, and reject a
   direction that cannot be tied to either facet (rule 1).
2. When auditing a shipped asset's consistency, check the sender
   facets (Physique, Personality, Culture) and the receiver facets
   (Reflection, Self-image, Relationship) separately — a sender-only
   pass is not a full consistency check (rule 2).
3. During a periodic identity-guide review, drop facets the brand no
   longer actually delivers on from the active identity statement
   rather than leaving them listed as aspirational (rule 3).

## Output shape

A facet-traceability note for each proposed visual direction, a
two-sided (sender/receiver) consistency audit result for each shipped
asset reviewed, and an updated identity statement with stale facets
removed or moved to a retired/under-consideration note.

## Decision rules

### 1. Require every new visual asset to trace to a stated Physique or Personality facet before shipping
- **Condition**: when a new visual direction (color, shape language, imagery style, typography mood) is proposed for a brand asset
- **Choice**: require the proposer to name which prism facet(s) — most concretely Physique (the tangible visual traits: shape, color, iconic features) or Personality (character/tone the visuals should project) — the choice is expressing, and reject a direction that cannot be tied to either facet as stated in the brand's own identity doc
- **Why**: Kapferer's model was built specifically to stop brand image (how a choice happens to look) from drifting away from brand identity (what the brand intends to stand for); a visual choice with no traceable facet is exactly the failure mode the prism was designed to catch
- **Source**: Kapferer, J-N., "Strategic Brand Management" (prism origin, 1990s); synthesis via Umbrex, "Define Brand Identity with Kapferer Brand Identity Prism", https://umbrex.com/resources/frameworks/marketing-frameworks/kapferer-brand-identity-prism/ ; Inkbot Design, "A Guide To Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism", https://inkbotdesign.com/kapferers-brand-identity-prism/
- **Counter-example test**: a proposed color shift justified only as "it looks more modern" with no reference to which prism facet "modern" is meant to serve fails this rule — "looks better" is an image judgment, not an identity-traced one.

### 2. Check the "sender" facets (Physique, Personality, Culture) and the "receiver" facets (Reflection, Self-image, Relationship) separately when auditing consistency
- **Condition**: when auditing whether a shipped asset is consistent with the brand's identity, not just internally attractive
- **Choice**: run the consistency check twice from two different questions — first, does this asset match what the brand intends to project (Physique/Personality/Culture — the sender side)? second, does this asset match how the target audience is meant to see themselves reflected and how they're meant to relate to the brand (Reflection/Self-image/Relationship — the receiver side)? A pass on only the sender side is not a full consistency check.
- **Why**: the prism's own structure splits into a sender dimension (brand communicates) and a receiver dimension (audience perceives) precisely because a brand can be internally coherent about what it wants to say while still failing to land with the audience it's for — checking only one side misses exactly the gap the model exists to expose
- **Source**: Formplus, "Understanding Kapferer's Brand Identity Prism: A Comprehensive Guide", https://www.formpl.us/blog/understanding-kapferers-brand-identity-prism-a-comprehensive-guide"
- **Counter-example test**: an asset review checklist that only asks "does this match our logo/color/tone rules" (sender-side Physique/Personality only) and has no question about target-audience self-image or relationship fails this rule — it audits only half the prism.

### 3. Drop identity facets the brand no longer actually delivers on, rather than keeping them in the guide as aspirational
- **Condition**: when a periodic identity-guide review finds a stated facet (a claimed Personality trait, a claimed Culture value) that recent shipped work and audience-facing material no longer actually expresses
- **Choice**: remove the stale facet from the active identity statement (moving it to a "retired/under consideration" note if historical continuity matters) rather than leaving it listed as current while nothing produced actually reflects it
- **Why**: an identity doc that lists facets the brand doesn't act on stops functioning as the sender-side reference the consistency check (rule 2) depends on — every subsequent audit either wrongly fails current work against a facet nobody is actually targeting, or the checker learns to silently ignore that line, which defeats the doc; the addition-only failure mode (keep old aspirational traits, bolt new ones on top) is the same subtractive-neglect pattern documented outside branding as well

- **Counter-example test**: an identity doc still listing "playful" as a core Personality trait when the last 12 months of shipped material is uniformly formal/corporate, with no update to the doc, fails this rule.
