# MECE-structuring rules (phase-1 proposal)

Decision rules for structuring the phase-1 proposal's 5 required
elements (decision framed, frameworks selected + why, evidence plan,
adoption rationale, plugin-reflection plan) so the set is mutually
exclusive and collectively exhaustive. Research trail: layer 2 (Barbara
Minto's MECE principle, verified at source) plus layer 1 (practitioner
issue-tree structuring practice).

## Rules

1. When drafting the proposal's element list, check each pair of
   sections for content overlap first — if the same fact or judgment
   would need to be restated in two sections, merge them or move the
   fact to whichever section owns it, because overlapping buckets is
   exactly what "mutually exclusive" forbids. source:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MECE_principle
2. When a proposal's frameworks-selected section lists a framework with
   no accompanying "why," treat that as a MECE-exhaustiveness gap, not a
   style nit — the required element is "frameworks selected + why," and
   a bare list without rationale does not satisfy the "why" half of the
   pairing. source: docs/issue-1174/proposals/operational-playbook-program.md
   (this rulebook's own governing role-directive, `PRODUCES` field)
3. When choosing how to split the analysis into sections, prefer the
   fastest reliable MECE splits named in practitioner guidance —
   two-part splits, formula-based splits (e.g. TAM = SAM + SOM),
   process-step splits, or an explicit "other" bucket — over an ad hoc
   list assembled from whatever facts were gathered first.

4. When the evidence plan section and the adoption-rationale section
   both cite the same source to justify different claims, do not
   duplicate the citation block — cite it once in whichever section the
   claim primarily belongs to and cross-reference by name from the
   other, keeping each section's content mutually exclusive.

5. When building the proposal as an issue tree (decision → sub-questions
   → evidence), keep sibling branches independent of each other — if
   answering one sub-question requires knowing another sibling's answer
   first, they are not properly separated and the branch structure needs
   re-cutting before drafting prose. source:

6. When the "plugin-reflection plan" element has no corresponding gate
   or plugin named anywhere else in the proposal, flag the proposal as
   not collectively exhaustive — reflection is one of the 5 required
   elements and an empty or vague plan leaves a gap in the coverage,
   not just a thin section. source:
   docs/issue-1174/proposals/operational-playbook-program.md
7. **REMOVAL**: when a draft section restates the decision already
   framed in the "decision framed" element using different words later
   in the document (e.g. a redundant "why this matters" paragraph before
   the evidence plan), cut the restatement rather than keep it for
   emphasis — MECE structuring treats restating an already-covered
   bucket as exactly the redundancy the principle exists to eliminate.

8. When perfect MECE cannot be achieved because two required elements
   genuinely share unavoidable context (e.g. evidence plan and adoption
   rationale both depend on the same market-data source), do not force
   an artificial split — practitioner guidance treats perfect MECE as an
   aspiration, not an absolute; state the shared dependency once and
   reference it, rather than duplicating or awkwardly forcing exclusivity.

9. When checking collective exhaustiveness, verify against the
   rulebook's own `PRODUCES` field (the 5 named elements) as the
   checklist, not against whatever the analyst remembers writing —
   a proposal missing one of the 5 named elements fails exhaustiveness
   even if every present section is well-written. source:
   docs/issue-1174/proposals/operational-playbook-program.md
10. When an "other" or miscellaneous bucket accumulates more than a
    small fraction of the proposal's content, treat that as a signal the
    real categories were mis-cut — split the miscellaneous bucket into
    properly named sub-elements rather than leaving it as a catch-all,
    since a bloated "other" bucket is the practitioner-named failure mode
    of a MECE split done too coarsely. source:
